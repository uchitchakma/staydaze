These benchmarks are some of the most trusted review sources in the hosting industry due to Ohashi&#8217;s transparent <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/methodology/\">methodology</a>. No hosting company sponsors the work. Instead, Ohashi charges a standard, publicly documented fee for participation that covers the cost of the tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Ohashi tested 33 companies with 79 different plans across seven different price tiers, including the WooCommerce tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If speed is one of your chief concerns when selecting a hosting company, these performance reviews may be of interest. The benchmarks include a Load Storm test designed to simulate real users visiting the site, logging in, and browsing (uncached performance). They also test cached performance, SSL, WP queries per second, performance on some computational and database operations, and a WebPageTest that fully loads the homepage and records how long it takes from 12 different locations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results are easy to examine at a glance. Top Tier (Full Star) status is given to hosts that perform well under the battery of tests:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Top Tier WordPress Hosting (Full Star)</strong></p><p>This is awarded to companies who maintain 99.9% uptime throughout the entire testing and show little to no performance degradation during load testing, primarily focused on error rate and consistent response times. Error rates above 0.1% and response times above 1000ms* will keep a company away from achieving Top Tier marks.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the budget &lt;$25/Month category, the 2022 Top Tier winners included 20i, 34SP, EasyWP by Namecheap, Eco Web Hosting, GreenGeeks, HostXNow, ICDSoft, LightningBase, MechanicWeb, Pressable, SiteGround, and WPX.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, in the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/benchmark/2022-enterprise-wordpress/\">Enterprise tier ($500+/month)</a>, there were far fewer participants but the majority of them achieved Top Tier status, including Performant Websites, Presslabs, Scaleforce powered by Virtuozzo, Servebolt (Scale + ACD), Servebolt, and WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second year Ohashi has performed WooCommerce hosting reviews. The tests are performed on a WooCommerce dummy website with Storefront set as the theme and <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/master/sample-data/sample_products.xml\">sample products</a> loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top Tier winners for WooCommerce hosting include GreenGeeks, Pressable, Servebolt, and WordPress.com.  Two others achieved Honorable Mentions &#8211; ICDSoft and SiteGround. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on &#8220;View full results&#8221; for any of the tiers will show a detailed breakdown of all the tests with comparison charts and summaries for each host participating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress Hosting Is Getting Faster</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the most remarkable trend is how fast things are getting,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;For example if we look at the enterprise tier from 2021 vs 2022, the fastest average response time (Static test) was 9ms and 6.4ms and p95 was 41ms to 20ms. The 3rd fastest p95 last year was 65ms which would be 7th (out of 9) fastest this year if you moved it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Despite the numbers already being staggeringly fast already, the whole cohort accelerated even faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not just at the high end, at the &lt;25 tier, on the Static test there was 1 company with under 100ms p95 last year (CynderHost &#8211; 61ms). This year you have three &#8211; Pressable (18ms), SiteGround (67ms), WPX (89ms).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the slow end, the slowest &lt;25 Static average response time was 267ms, last year there were 5 companies with equal or slower averages (max being over 1200ms).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said there may be some selection bias as companies who do badly may not want to participate again and filter themselves out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But some of those companies improved quite a bit like GoDaddy was 295ms to 234ms which is a 61ms improvement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to call out the companies who have sometimes struggled on these tests, and keep participating. I respect them and it makes me happy to see them making continuous improvements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I do give awards for companies who do well, I think it&#8217;s important to recognize that not doing as well isn&#8217;t a failure, it&#8217;s about what the companies do with that information and how they improve their services. Overall, it seems everyone is improving and that&#8217;s a win for hosts and consumers alike.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi said one of his goals for 2022 is talking with the companies to explain the value of participating. Beyond the value of the benchmarks themselves, these reviews help the ecosystem push for better performance. One of Ohashi&#8217;s testing policies is a big driver for this: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;The hosting packages are as close to default as possible. In some circumstances where turning on performance enhancements is very simple, e.g. clicking an option to turn on caching, this will be done. These changes must be obvious or communicated clearly in the welcome email so that every user is guaranteed to at least be presented the option. Otherwise everything is as-is for new customers upon sign up to avoid, as much as possible, the extra benefit of companies knowing they are being tested.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies that do well in these tests are those that have embraced performance by default, so that any performance improving technology is already turned on or presented proactively to customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the things I got a degree in is economics and we talk about opt-in vs opt-out policies like organ donation and how defaults can drastically influence outcomes,&#8221; Ohashi said. &#8220;By forcing opt-in performance improvements, I don&#8217;t know how many thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of sites have been positively impacted by these benchmarks without ever being aware because hosting companies are forced to enable better defaults.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohashi also works with the companies on things that do not make it into the benchmarks, such as pointing out issues with onboarding/UI/UX experience and reporting bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve probably used more different WordPress hosting companies than anyone else in the world at this point (I have to be in the top 10 doing these benchmarks for a decade right?),&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I cannot figure out how to do something in your system, it&#8217;s probably your system, not me. I truly want to see everyone do better, because everyone wins in that scenario and I will try to help as much as I can to make that happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/\">2022 WordPress Hosting Performance Benchmarks</a> for a more detailed breakdown of all the different pricing tiers and a full explanation of the testing methodology. Past years&#8217; benchmarks are also available on the website. This year Load Storm went out of business, so Ohashi replicated the tests into k6. All of his load testing scripts are open source and <a href=\"https://github.com/ReviewSignal/k6-WordPress-benchmarks\">available on GitHub</a>, so others are welcome to use them for testing their own sites or building their own testing suites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 02:40:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: SiteCare Acquires Maintainn from WebDevStudios\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136520\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/sitecare-acquires-maintainn-from-webdevstudios\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2720:\"<p>More consolidation is happening in the WordPress maintenance services space, as SiteCare <a href=\"https://sitecare.com/blog/sitecare-acquires-maintainn/\">announced</a> it has acquired <a href=\"https://maintainn.com/\">Maintainn</a>, a long-time competitor, from WebDevStudios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As we’ve grown and our clientele has grown [with] definitely more of a focus on the enterprise and big business, we’ve simply kind of grown away where that side of the house wasn’t really in line with the web dev side of the house in terms of the clients we&#8217;re working with,&#8221; WebDevStudios CEO Brad Williams said in an interview with <a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/wordpress-support-company-sitecare-acquires-maintainn-from-webdevstudios/\">The WP Minute</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So it’s been a bit of a, struggle in terms of how best to support those clients, because of course we want to take care of our clients and they are a big reason why we’re here. That’s why, Lisa, my partner, and myself, kind of took a step back and said, maybe this doesn&#8217;t make sense for WebDev, where we&#8217;re at, where we&#8217;re continuing to go.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WebDevStudios began focusing more on taking on larger, more technical projects that run WordPress at scale for clients like The Wall Street Journal, Starbucks, Microsoft, Viacom, and the NBA, the company struggled to effectively market Maintainn with messaging that conveyed its distinction from WebDevStudios&#8217; enterprise development offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Struggle of the message, the marketing message to say, hey, we can support, blogs, SMB all the way up to, enterprise and Microsoft is a hard message to get across,&#8221; Williams said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We knew that the marketing of that would be almost impossible for us to, to nail. It really just came from the separation of where WebDev was kind of growing more towards the enterprise and Maintainn was primarily supporting more of that SMB to to mid-tier.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintainn&#8217;s current maintenance plan customers, which range from $49-$249/month, will remain at the same pricing for one year. SiteCare may reevaluate these pricing tiers in the future. Customers are promised the same level of service as their current plan but may also receive some enhanced benefits that they had not received before. In addition to maintenance services, SiteCare also offers its customers a range of digital marketing services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is SiteCare&#8217;s second acquisition of a WordPress site management company after acquiring WP Site Care in 2018. The company will take on all of Maintainn&#8217;s assets but the employees will remain with WebDevStudios.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 18:47:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"Gutenberg Times: Live Q &amp; A: Block-First Approach at Pew Research Center\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=21696\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/live-q-a-block-first-approach-at-pew-research-center/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67879:\"<p>On July 22, 2022, Michael Piccorossi, Head of Digital Strategy and Seth Rubenstein, Lead Developer at Pew Research Center talked to co-hosts Anne McCarthy, WordPress Product Liason and Birgit Pauli-Haack, WordPress Developer advocate and curater at Gutenberg Times, on they use a mixture of Core and Custom Blocks to streamline their publishing process, and to create powerful charts and quizzes for the Pew Research Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/sethrubenstein/gutenberg-times-livestream-examples\">Seth Rubenstein&#8217;s Example Code Repo</a> (GitHub) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/37943\">Issue: Allow usage of block based &#8220;template parts&#8221; without using block based &#8220;templates&#8221;</a>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGFDbmN0Y3ViaFFBU1RHM0xtYkZ4cVV5RGgyZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsSGRKTzhCRGJQc3Bpd3kzc1A5cVo0dmM4WThacVJyLXhCa1NDSllzckwtLUNxSTlKajZDTmtKUFhfN3h2TXdNb29ESkh5MVczNVZGNE03WnlldDdDM09uNUlxZ3BEZTlBYTNPTGNNWlFEMHJyV3cwVQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3aWn55a&v=bvQYPa5vxVk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://bit.ly/3aWn55a</a> (GitHub) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/comparing-patterns-template-parts-and-reusable-blocks/\">Comparing Patterns, Template Parts, and Reusable Blocks</a> (WordPress Support) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24934\">Tracking issue: Missing Query block functionality</a> (GitHub) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/07/11/fse-program-testing-call-15-category-customization/\">FSE Program Testing Call #15: Category Customization</a> (WordPress Make Blog)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect on Twitter </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Michael Piccorossi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpiccorossi\">@mpiccorossi</a></li><li>Seth Rubenstein <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFYwNDRSQ2gzdEtDNUhYcFhLY0F5QmtrQlZEQXxBQ3Jtc0trVEdjY25XR1dFOWNWY3BvYS1vX0I0elcwbjlWeVhLaVFMRkM2T3hzWk1yV1g5QUxWeHlKbHMwX1R4bjR3Sm5lLUpEQlVaaUVqRno2TnpkcEJTbG9hUUdzaXJ6VWg1ckptSHRCTUtKTVJDNzVrZ3Jjcw&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSethRubenstein&v=bvQYPa5vxVk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@SethRubenstein</a></li><li>Pew Research <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVBuZ09tWjB1Nms5OVEyRUlsS3J5eEdfQVZNZ3xBQ3Jtc0tubXkzMkUxTDBsQ2FyQ2xma3dsYmRydkxldzlmUTZSMVJSZjZSSVZMdGMzbXVKbnNpdXhDeXVqQ2tQM3E4MU1kQzMyVi1tNmNxU3QteHg2VTNmMkc1ckJNOXZNVS1OUkJtLVJhRFJ6aWhVbWJTX2VMZw&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fpewresearch&v=bvQYPa5vxVk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@pewresearch</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Speaker information</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 is-nowrap wp-block-group alignwide\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 is-vertical wp-block-group\">\n<img /><strong>Michael Pioccorossi, Director of Digital Strategy</strong>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Piccorossi is the Director of Digital Strategy at the Pew Research Center where he leads a multidisciplinary team that includes web development, design, product, user experience, analytics, social media and video.

It&#8217;s a great way to connect with people who are using Gutenberg and we have an excellent show today for you. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack, and I&#8217;m the host of and the publisher of Gutenberg Times. Thanks for joining everybody. With me is a co-host, Anne McCarthy, who&#8217;s the WordPress Product Liaison. Howdy, Anne, thank you for being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Thanks for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to introduce how we&#8217;re going to talk to folks in the Pew Research Center about how they use a mixture of core and custom blocks to streamline their publishing process and to create a lot of the stuff that you know and love from them, with their charts and quizzes and all that good stuff. So with me here today, Seth Rubenstein, lead developer&#8230; Rubenstein. Apologies, lead developer and Michael Piccorossi Director of Digital Strategy. Thank you both so much for coming Seth and Michael apologies if I completely ruined both your last names and thank you so much for taking the time to just talk about all the cool stuff you&#8217;re doing at the WordPress block editor. I know it&#8217;s going to inspire a lot of folks. How are you both doing today? We&#8217;ll start with Seth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Oh, I&#8217;m doing fine. I&#8217;m living in the middle of a post-home renovation construction zone, but other than that I&#8217;m doing great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Amazing. Minor details, Michael, how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. Thanks. Thanks for having us. We&#8217;re really excited to talk about the work that we&#8217;re doing and how we might help other people with what they&#8217;re trying to do. So, thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m so happy. Totally thrilled. I couldn&#8217;t wait because we were talking about this since end of May and now it&#8217;s end of June. I had to wait two months, but we do proper introduction in less than a minute, but I have a few housekeeping notes. So please use the chat feature to let us know where you are watching from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then for the question process, for those who are watching on YouTube livestream, use the chat bot next to the video player for your questions. Here on Zoom, use the Q&amp;A button on the bottom of the screen for your questions and the chat bubble to share your thoughts and comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little reminder, yes, please be kind even if you disagree. This is a family-friendly endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we head first into the behind-the-scenes tour we are going to get, I want to ask both of you to tell us briefly about your WordPress story and how long have you been using it. Seth first, and then Michael.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. I&#8217;ll go first. I mean, I&#8217;ve been using WordPress for, I don&#8217;t know, 18 years or something like that now? I started using WordPress in college. I was responsible for all the school&#8217;s clubs and newspaper, websites and all that stuff. So that&#8217;s when I started to learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I just went successively from one job to the next, building out different WordPress products. I think I built one of the first learning management systems in WordPress many, many years ago, in my first job. Then I started at Pew in 2015 and they were doing some interesting stuff with WordPress and WordPress Multisite and we just went from there. I&#8217;m excited to show you what we have built over the last couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that&#8217;s a great career and a lot of nonprofit and going from Drupal to WordPress must have been a major switch of culture as well. So, Michael, how about you? What is your story?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ve been doing digital stuff for more than 20 years, more years than I like to admit sometimes. Prior to Pew Research, I managed a team at U.S. News &amp; World Report. We built a custom-based, a Python-based CMS and e-commerce system. That was back like in 2006. So I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of different content management things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started at Pew Research in 2009. When I got here, we had four different CMSs, none of them WordPress, 2 DotNet, Drupal, custom PHP so it was really kind of a mess. One of my first hires after I got here was another person you may know from the WordPress community, Russ Heimlick. He was our first web developer and he and I talked about where we should take this organization and we decided that WordPress was the right way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we ran a custom-hosted version out of a data center in Virginia for a while and then Seth joined us, as he said in 2015. For a couple of years, we were managing on our own AWS infrastructure and then we moved over to WordPress VIP in 2018, and we&#8217;ve been really happy working in that environment ever since. So we&#8217;ve really never been happier and we&#8217;re really committed to the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I love this. This is very cool. I&#8217;m going to later have a question so just tuck this away for now, around why you chose WordPress, especially with what seems to be more of an emphasis on the data side of things. I&#8217;ve read books about how for humanity&#8217;s sake, we need to find ways to preserve data for the long term. So I&#8217;m curious, that played into part of, for human knowledge sake of, what platform can we choose that will have the most longevity and sustainability into the future? So I&#8217;m fascinated by that entire concept when it comes to this kind of work and research, but just tuck that away for later. I just had to mention it for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Oh, Birgit, you&#8217;re muted. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; to type some things. I apologize, our chat was disabled for a few minutes here and now you can all tell us where you&#8217;re watching from. I&#8217;m sorry about that, but it seems to be that Zoom is changing the default settings all the time, and I had this set up. Well anyway, so Michael, so what do you exactly do at the Pew Research Center?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Sure, sure. So me personally, I&#8217;m the director of Digital Strategy. It&#8217;s really product and strategy and like I said, I&#8217;ve been here for 13 years now. So I oversee a larger team of 20 people. In addition to the web dev, I also oversee the design team, video products, social, email, user experience, and audience measurement. So basically I&#8217;m the chief cat hurder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;re similar to a lot of news organizations. So I really describe us as, we&#8217;re news adjacent. So, the work of the center is, if you&#8217;re not familiar with it, we are a nonpartisan, non-advocacy, public opinion polling, demographic analysis and a variety of other social science research. Historically, the roots of the center is in survey research and polling, but in the last five years, we&#8217;ve really made a strategic shift to seek new ways of measuring public opinion and that facilitated us starting our data labs team. They&#8217;re doing data science and computational social science so that&#8217;s a new area of research for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our core product, as is baked into our name is, nonpartisan, non-advocacy research. So these authoritative, data-driven reports, they&#8217;re big things, they&#8217;re multi chapter, and those are still really in many ways, one of our core products, but we also do shorter but equally rigorous and authoritative data-rich blog posts and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the digital team here also, in addition to doing all of the regular day-to-day publishing, we&#8217;ll publish in a given year maybe 40 or 50 data-driven features based on center research. And they run the gamut from D3 visualizations to interactive maps, data lookup tools, essays, and quizzes. And I don&#8217;t want to overlook the fact that we&#8217;ll publish about 2,500 static charts in a given year and it&#8217;s really an important part of how we get our information out there. So shout out to our design team, I think they&#8217;re the best in the business and I think they do great stuff. So it just doesn&#8217;t have to be interactive to be important to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in general, one of our real special sauce for these features that we do is, allowing users to see themselves in our data. So Anne mentioned some of our quizzes and things like that. That&#8217;s really in terms of broad reach, we know that for the public, that&#8217;s what they want to see. So that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, like I said, we are really similar to a news organization and we&#8217;re involved in a lot of the same communities as news orgs, Online News Association, NYCAR, the News Product Alliance, those are sort of the people we hang out with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to being a pointing head and middle manager, I&#8217;m really a product guy at heart so I really do spend a lot of time in WordPress. So that&#8217;s my story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Well, thank you, Michael. I had no idea about the full scope of the Pew Research Center. I only have been an avid reader of the internet research since the early 90s, I think because that was the one research where you knew who&#8217;s online and who&#8217;s online where, and especially then with the advent of user-generated content, social media, it was really nice. Yeah. It was the one authority about internet usage, especially in America. So I&#8217;m really happy that I know now more about it. So Seth, what do you do at Pew Research Center?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Well, I am the lead developer. So when I started at Pew, there were a few developers, but there wasn&#8217;t a defined dev team and there wasn&#8217;t modern dev team practices. So a lot of the challenge was getting that spun up in the first couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we have three other developers beside myself. We have two developers that focus on these digital features that Michael alluded to maps, interactives, we call them scrolly teleinteractives. You scroll through and different things happen. Then another developer and myself, we manage the majority of the WordPress app and especially now, the Gutenberg infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I just want to go through the chat. Hi to Washington DC. Heimlich is here. No. Nice, wonderful. Bud is here. Hi Bud. Henrietta, Matt and well, yeah, Ann is online the chat and thank you for greeting everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Genesis of this live Q&amp;A is actually that I, around the Web 6.0 release, Seth tweeted the following, &#8220;For all its naysayers, Gutenberg is a gamechanger for digital and news apps. It&#8217;s a force multiplier for your team and we&#8217;ve spent about the last three years going all-in, in block development.&#8221; Then in the thread, you shared quite a few videos of examples and it was really interesting. I jumped at it and DMed you if you and your team come on the show. So what is it that you&#8217;re going to show us today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. So I have a couple of examples from that kind of thread. I think we&#8217;ll dive in and I&#8217;ll show you how we can build out homepages, that&#8217;s one thing, how we are using Gutenberg in a quasi full-site editing method to edit taxonomy archive pages, as well as a couple examples of how we build out digital features like quizzes, like charts and interactives now, some of these scrolly tele things I&#8217;ve told you about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have this other concept of a quote sorter, where we get quotes from the public and we sort them into different groups and things so you can browse that information. We&#8217;ve just created the ability for this, and it&#8217;s not launched yet, to build those out in Gutenberg. So let me share my screen here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that would be lovely. Well to the audience, if you have questions, just put it in the chat and after the demo, well, Anne and I get the privilege of first questions and then we&#8217;ll go through your questions and have Seth and Michael answer them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead, Seth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; So the first thing that you see when you hit pewresearch.org is this page here. In the past, this might have been something built out with God knows how many short codes, if that was even possible at all. So now, and I&#8217;ll just kind of, I have a couple tabs lined up here, now, it&#8217;s very simple for an editor to come in and build out a homepage, especially with things like block patterns. We&#8217;ve established some of these basic sections of the homepage that you can just drag and drop in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;ll just throw one together real quick and maybe we&#8217;ll do that. So the first block that we built in our journey on Gutenberg was what we call story item block. It&#8217;s definitely our most used block. It&#8217;s our most custom, the most developed out block. With it, you can just drop in a story and we have a couple of different variations. We&#8217;re using block variations throughout our block library for quick shortcuts to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: It&#8217;s so cool you&#8217;re using variations for this, I just have to say. I&#8217;m like&#8230; I&#8217;m already seeing the pieces and like this is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And using WordPress REST API and all of the WordPress components to build these things out. So let me just type in a post. I&#8217;m running this on my local dev so it will be a little bit slower. An editor can just search for a post or they can drop in either a live link or another feature that they requested, which I think has come in handy is the edit URL for like an article that&#8217;s not been published yet, so we can go try to grab some information about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then once in here, this block is using block context as well. We have found block context to be extremely important to our efforts, to guide producers into how things should be set up and set restrictions on how things should work. So for example, we have our own grid block as well. If I were redoing it today, I probably would stick with the core column blocks, but this was years ago and there were some features and stuff and we didn&#8217;t know how to tap into core blocks the way we do now. So we just went through and made our own grid block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The column block passes down through block context, the width of the column so that, for example, a story item block, when you&#8217;re choosing the image position can say, &#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t do left or right position because this column is not large enough.&#8221; So this is great because this makes sure that, once again, I go back to shortcuts because this is how it used to be. With shortcuts, you really could place those restrictions on the interface that maybe had to happen on the back end and an editor would go and drop in a short code and they will, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t look the way I wanted it to look. I didn&#8217;t know about these restrictions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now an editor can come in here and do all this visually. They could set an image size, enable different features, like bulleted items underneath here. They can include links in here, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we are also using the query block. This is one of our more recent core block modifications. I&#8217;ll actually get rid of this to show you how that works. So you can drop in a query block and we are registering through the block API, our own variation here. We&#8217;ve got all the basic query block things, but we&#8217;ve added our own thing, which will drop in the default settings for the story item block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think also alludes to what I was describing in that thread of our block first approach. Everything is a block in the site, or at least everything&#8217;s moving in that direction, to be a block in the site. To give you an idea of what that looks like, lets just save this real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important thing and probably the most important thing about Gutenberg is the fact that what you build here, hopefully is how it&#8217;s going to look on the front end. We&#8217;re still dealing with some typography stuff. I think when we go in all-in a full-site editing, that&#8217;ll be more one-to-one. But now if I come over to our new homepage&#8230; Come on. What I&#8217;ve built out here is exactly as you&#8217;re going to see it on the front so there should be no mistakes, there should be no, this doesn&#8217;t look how I thought it was going to look like, all that stuff is visible in the back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the front end here, in the query block, obviously, I&#8217;m sure most people aren&#8217;t aware the nuts and bolts on how the query block works, but on the back end, obviously there&#8217;s a block called post template block and that is rendering out your blocks using PHP on the backend. This is a story in a block, basically being rendered out in PHP on the backend. These aren&#8217;t actually static blocks. These are dynamic. So the query block gets the information. It says, &#8220;There&#8217;s a post type we want a query,&#8221; then it outputs all that using the story item block as a template. So that&#8217;s homepages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the other thing I wanted to dive into was the taxonomy pages. Where do I have that? So this is an example of a taxonomy page for us, our most important taxonomy topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Sorry, but so what I&#8217;m hearing is, that you are actually way ahead of the Gutenberg team. You have build query blocks and templates all before it actually went to the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; We did build out our own query block originally, because when we first started looking at doing query blocks in places, the query block did not have taxonomy support, or at least very, very minimal taxonomy support. That&#8217;s since changed so we have now moved over to the core query block, but there were a lot of cases where we had to build out stuff before it was ready in Gutenberg, and then come back later and figure out if we were going to use the core block that Gutenberg had built out. In the most cases we do, we do end up going with whatever the core block is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is, I think, our best example of our approach to full-site editing before we got full-site editing. So this is your standard taxonomy archive page, but we have two positions, one we call menu and the other we&#8217;re called top. Actually, we have another one at the bottom called bottom. These link up to a post type that we&#8217;re calling taxonomy block area, which is not super creative, but it describes what it does. There&#8217;s a taxonomy for that for location, menu, top, bottom. So you can go into here and you can say, edit the menu, edit the top, whatever and just like on the homepage, you can build out these featured content areas in Gutenberg using whatever block you want, in this case story item. We also have a promo block we built out on our own MailChimp block and that&#8217;s what you get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi:</em> Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Then&#8230; Yeah, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I just wanted to add, yes. So last summer we launched a site redesign with a whole new information architecture and a multi-level content taxonomy. As Seth pointed out, these topic pages were really the central component of that entire redesign. Being able to manage these in the ways that he&#8217;s discussing has really been transformational for us. One of the things I like is, you can create one of these topic blocks and assign it to multiple pages if they&#8217;re the same. We can also create these pages in a very short period of time, literally in minutes. Usually, it&#8217;s more the editorial decisions that take longer than any of the actual production stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; So yeah. Yeah. The other nice thing is that you can schedule these, because we are ostensibly, a news site. We, I think we, Mike alluded to, like to think of ourselves as being a resource for the news rather than being an actual news service, but we post things that are on the topics of the day and so we can change these. We can schedule changes out. We can schedule tomorrow&#8217;s homepage, we can schedule next week&#8217;s big release of some report we have, we can schedule the topic page changes that&#8217;ll happen for that, because this is just a post-type. So we just create a new post, slot it into this topic in the top location and schedule it for next Wednesday to publish at 10:00 AM. This will change at 10:00 AM. So that&#8217;s also, I think been a really great feature and that of course applies to homepages and any of these full-site editing things that we&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the other thing is that we&#8230; This is one of the things that we&#8217;re going to have to struggle with in the next couple months is, we also built out our own navigation block. When I say we built out, we forked the early efforts of the Gutenberg team&#8217;s navigation block and we went a little bit further with how we needed it to work. So a lot of that change was making these different menu links that would point to topic pages specifically, and stuff like this and the ability to have a sub menu and that would follow our CSS and stuff like that. So that&#8217;s taxonomy pages, that&#8217;s full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I wanted to show was quizzes. We might not have enough time to show us some of these other interactive, but the quizzes stuff, this we launched last fall in order to support what is by far, our most popular product. I mean, it blows our analytics out of the water every year. That is our political typology quiz. It&#8217;s definitely one of our complex interactives too. If you haven&#8217;t taken this, you should, it&#8217;s pretty fun. People will enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ve taken this with friends, like at a bar years ago. We&#8217;re like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s all take the quiz and we can talk about it.&#8221; Yes. This is really fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; And we have a group feature too. So if you sign up for an account on our website, you get a little login and you can go create your own little community group. So you can say, here&#8217;s how this group of people is responding to this, which is fun. So here&#8217;s what it looks like. Go through, ask questions, to answer them, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before, we were using Gravity Forms for this. Before that, there was a completely homegrown system. That was, we were finding, kind of taking down the site under load. So we switched to Gravity Forms pretty quickly when I started just to get things stable. We could have stayed there, right? We could have kept iterating on that Gravity Forms built system that we had, but we want everything to be a block, we want everything to be under Gutenberg. So we built our quiz builder in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an idea of how that works, this is a framework that we&#8217;ve played around with, to great success. I&#8217;m just calling it the controller block paradigm. So here we have one parent level block, the controller. All it does is, it stores some attributes. It doesn&#8217;t really do anything, at least on the back end here and it&#8217;s just a way for us to contain inside blocks or inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then within that, we have a pages block that controls the pages and a results block that controls the results. Then in each of these, you can insert any of the core blocks, headings, images, whatever, but we also have a question block and then an answer block. As you go through here, you just type out what the answer is or what the question is. You can set an image, question type, all these sort things. This is way more visual than we had, and what you build out here is what you see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a smaller example that I can show you a little bit more of what&#8217;s going on in the back end. For example, this quiz. This is a pretty simple quiz for us. This is what we call it knowledge quiz, as opposed to typology quiz, meaning there are correct answers here. So as you go through, you just click the little smiley face to determine that&#8217;s the correct answer, not correct answer. But then when we get down to the bottom here, I think this is the most exciting part, or the best example of block context, is, the results block. So here, an editor can drop in all the different things that you might see in a results page, &#8220;You scored X out of whatever, share your score.&#8221; You can build out some horizontal bar chart blocks that we&#8217;ve built out, all this sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have a general response table block. Let me just run through this quiz real quick and show you how that works. So when you hit the quiz, at first, what we do is, on the back end in PHP, we&#8217;re pulling out all of the question and the answer blocks and we&#8217;re formatting it out so that you get the correct layout. None of these are going to be right. I&#8217;m going to get a terrible score, but just click through some of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: We&#8217;re not here to judge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; No. Might have missed one. That&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You won&#8217;t be graded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Okay. So then you submit your quiz. When you submit the quiz, we store your results as an archetype rather than each individual entry. So we say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s all the possible combinations of answers. Here&#8217;s what you gave. Let&#8217;s store that.&#8221; That way, the next person that gives that possible combination of answers, we&#8217;re not duplicating database space for no reason. We just store that archetype of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you hit the quiz page again, with URL rewrite here for this archetype query bar, we go to the database, we grab that. Then through block context, we pass that through the controller block as your score. So that means that all of the blocks put in the results block, grab that context from the controller block, what the score is, and they can change accordingly. Maybe the bar chart changes to match what your score is. This thing changes to whatever your score is. Then of course the table response goes through and it gets the database entry and returns all this stuff through block context to the table block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was really exciting for us. That proved out the concept that we could do interactive things. We could build out little mini web apps, basically, for users and they could interact with them and we could construct a data model around that. So that&#8217;s our quizzes. What else do I have for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those are pretty neat, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Chart builder. This is definitely one of the more exciting things we&#8217;ve been working on lately. We launched this in the spring and it&#8217;s a twofold project for us. One there&#8217;s the backend charting library and then there is the WordPress plugin part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me get this load again. As I mentioned, we have three developers on our team. One other developer is working with me on all this stuff. This is from one of our other developers, Ben Wormald. He spearheaded this project and it came out just fantastic. Not only did we gain the ability for editors to come in and make charts, but using the Gutenberg PHP API, we are using this in a more static database, which I&#8217;ll show you in a moment, to generate charts for that. So it provides us one endpoint for accessing charts and creating charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it starts off with a table. This one has a lot of data, just an example I threw together. We&#8217;re using block transforms here, so we can target the table block and say-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: You are using everything, you have the you have the transforms, you have-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seth Rubenstein:&nbsp; We&#8217;re using the whole kitchen sink. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. This is really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; So you can start off with the chart builder block and that&#8217;ll have a table in there and you can fill that information, or you can just start out with a table and convert that to a chart. So I&#8217;ll do that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once again, the concept here is, you have a controller block, the builder controller, you have your table for your data. Then if we come down to the bottom here, you&#8217;ve got your chart. As you edit data, let me just see if I can change this, you&#8217;ll see that this stuff updates in real time, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in the chart itself&#8230; Oops, I think this data&#8217;s not formatted for that, you can customize pretty much all the visual aspects, spacing, what type of chart it is, colors, et cetera, et cetera. Let me let this load again one more time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: So fond of live demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it? Isn&#8217;t it great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I was doing some the other day where I was like, &#8220;Let me make this really dramatic,&#8221; and then it broke and I was like, &#8220;Got it. Okay, cool. I found the edge.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Seth, this is independent of whatever charting library you want to use, correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; That&#8217;s correct. Yeah. I spoke about this in the thread that I posted to Twitter. Some people were asking questions about it. And that we do intend to open source the block at some point so you&#8217;ll gain the ability to convert tables to charts and then pick all your different settings that you might have, but it will be up to you to create the middleware to link that to your own charting library. We won&#8217;t be open sourcing our charting library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let me just see. I mean, we have a lot of options here. I&#8217;m not going to go through all of these. Let me just tweak some of the visual stuff for better effect. So you can tweak this however you want. We&#8217;re also using the resizing component so that you could do that visually in real time if you&#8217;d like. You can go in and give this title, test charts or a subtitle, whatever you want. So best chart builder, there&#8217;s a lot more complex things you can do with it. This is a very simple chart. To give you an idea of once again, our whole block process, let me just go to this page real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a database that we run. It&#8217;s very exhaustive, called the religious landscape study. It has a lot of information about all the various religious groups in the United States, populations, things like this. In those, we have a lot of charts. Maps are not part of it yet, but all of these charts, all the bar charts, pie charts, and things like that, you might see that in this product are actually rendering out a block via PHP. So this is just the chart builder block being manually rendered through PHP on the back end. That way, any updates we make to chart builder for editors also get applied here to this product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s another important part to make about Gutenberg is that it&#8217;s not just in the Gutenberg editor, anything you make there, any block you make there you can also do in PHP. I think that&#8217;s important for maybe the PHP-only developers in the WordPress community to know is that, this doesn&#8217;t have to be just a JavaScript-only thing. You can utilize this using PHP as well. So that&#8217;s chart builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s all the demos I have for right now. I do have a repo I was going to share of some of the modifications that we&#8217;ve done to core blocks. So like I walk through those real quick. Let me just pull open a post, because I think that&#8217;s probably the best example of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I would just one add one thing on chart builder. Since we do so many charts, it&#8217;s unlikely that we&#8217;re going to do all of our charts using chart builder, but for really custom-lead charts, or these data-driven acts like Seth just showed it, it&#8217;s really fantastic and we&#8217;d like to be able to use more of it when it&#8217;s appropriate for the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. No not every chart will be this, so it&#8217;s right. Yeah. Sometimes it&#8217;s just the fidelity that you go with a static chart that we just can&#8217;t achieve. I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;d ever be able to achieve in Wizzy Wig drag-and-drop builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is an example of a post for us. Once again, what you see here is what you get. This is another block that we built out, the collapsible block. We use these at the top of all of our posts. What else was I going to show about that? Let this load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other things that we had to build out with Gutenberg, one of the other things that Gutenberg gives you is, I think a great UI library that we&#8217;ve never really had in WordPress, with WordPress components and with inspector controls and advanced panels and stuff like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So another part of our Gutenberg journey was not just the blocks, but how are we going to utilize this editor to its fullest extent for our publishing platform? Part of that is, we&#8217;ve built out some controls for the stuff that you might see here in the sidebar. So the report PDF, top line promo, you can change these things around, you can drag and drop them just in a more visual way than you were able to before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, we used advanced custom fields for all this stuff, and that was great and all, but once again, there was only so much you could do to customize how that looked, how it worked. It had to fit in that ACF framework, but here, we&#8217;re given all those tools by Gutenberg through components to build out exactly what we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things here is, this is a block. The table contents is a block that&#8217;s being rendered out in PHP on the back end. What that also means is, that if you build out an essay or something and you want to throw a table of contents in, you can. You can just throw the table of contents block in the editor. But one of the core customizations that we had to do, we&#8217;ve done a number, is, add support to the heading block to support our table of contents block. So when you&#8217;re going through here, let&#8217;s go to&#8230; Well, actually this is using an older version of that block, not a good example, but I&#8217;ll change it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re going through here, you can type in a heading block, right? Just, and we&#8217;ve added a little icon. Not much is going on here. We&#8217;ve added one attribute called is chapter, and then we&#8217;ve added an icon to toggle that on or off. So I&#8217;m going to toggle that on. Then this might freak out because of the variety of blocks from this older post and it didn&#8217;t show up, but each of these is one of our older blocks called the chapter block, another thing we had to build out before we could figure out how we were going to book into core blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that works is&#8230; This is a high level, I&#8217;ll share this link in the chat so people can take a look at these examples. I&#8217;ve got two examples here. One is how we&#8217;ve added chapter support to headings and how we&#8217;ve added an alternate mobile background for the cover block. So that when you&#8217;re on mobile, maybe you get a different sized image for your cover block than you might get on desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the heading block is comprised of two things obviously. One is using the PHP API that Gutenberg affords is adding an attribute in. It can be very easy to do. You can just use the block type metadata filter to change a lot of things, but specifically you can splice in new attributes in this case this chapter, which is just a bullion yes or no. Then you can affect the rendering of it using the render block filter. We&#8217;re doing this in a lot of places with the core blocks. We say if you do have the chapter attribute and it&#8217;s true, then we just add a little data attribute to the H element. So that&#8217;s a very simple example. People can take a look at this and use this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another part of that obviously is the actual little toolbar icon itself. Once again, this is pretty simple too, using the filters, the JavaScript filters in Gutenberg. So you intercept the editing block. You say, Hey, if this isn&#8217;t the heading block, just give what was already there. Otherwise, we put in a little toolbar button and click it. Sets the attribute or unsets it. Then also have a variation which I alluded to. We use variations a lot as shortcuts. So you could just type in slash chapter if you wanted to and that would insert a heading with the chapter already selected. So it&#8217;s pretty easy to actually take a core block and give it completely new functionality that it didn&#8217;t have before, which I think is great. We&#8217;re trying to get more of our stuff into using core blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have any examples of this, but probably our most modified core block is the group block. We&#8217;ve added the ability to make it sticky, so that a group will stick to the top of the pages you scroll. We&#8217;ve added the ability to set a responsive threshold. When you reach set threshold, then it will move itself to this div or this idea or something that so that editors can change things around the page based on whether you&#8217;re on mobile or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other example is, in the cover block, we are adding another media field, or actually I guess, more of an ID field so that you can associate an image ID so that when you go to mobile, the cover block, we use a different version of the image. Same thing here. Intercept the block edit. You say, if you&#8217;re not the cover, just go ahead and return to what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, we have a little panel that we insert into the editor and a component that we&#8217;ve written. It&#8217;s a riff on a variety of different things in core for a drop zone for media. That&#8217;s also in this example if people want to use it. On the back end, it&#8217;s pretty simple here too. We&#8217;re using jetpack_is_mobile to detect if someone&#8217;s on mobile. If so, we get the image ID and splice it in, replace the image with that. So these are pretty easy, simple core block customizations, but I think if people dive in here, they might get a feel for what is possible for taking core blocks and making your own block library out of that basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Thanks so much for putting that in GitHub too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, no problem. No problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; But also just one last thing, this is a story in a block being rendered out in PHP. This is actually one of those full-site editing template block areas I told you about before. So we&#8217;re going to have something at the end of our sidebar. We have a little block area there that people can go into Gutenberg and drop this stuff out. Michael manages this most popular list using every usable block so that I can show up on the homepage or the sidebar anywhere else and we added it in one place and it edits everywhere. Yeah. So I think that&#8217;s all of my demos today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah. We use reusable blocks in a couple of different contexts so, there&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. We use them at the end of posts as well for various promos, newsletter signups, this sort of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: This was an awesome demonstration. Thank you so much. I&#8217;m totally thrilled that you brought some code examples that we can share with the developers that are watching and also maybe come back to in the recorded version and want to follow up on, on some of the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. No problem. Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So what are our first questions here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ll just say I&#8217;m itching to ask a bunch of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah. Can I jump in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I want to just drop this GitHub issue in that I think will be of interest. This is like hyper practical, but just around allowing usage of block-based template parts without actually accessing the whole template. A lot of what you&#8217;re describing with the taxonomy pages fuels very similar to that, where you can create template areas and then have access to just edit those. So that&#8217;s something I really look forward to and I see as a huge way&#8230; I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of different page agencies and organizations that&#8217;s what they&#8217;d love to have access to. It&#8217;s like we can define a template area and just allow people to edit that, that would be huge rather than opening up the whole gamut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: So I wanted to put that out there. And I definitely think you could have some really cool insights in helping shape this going forward so I want to encourage, be like, bring all your insights and all your experience of maybe what has tripped up users or what features you&#8217;d want to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: &#8230; all that good stuff. Yeah. I&#8217;d love to go back to the original, why WordPress? Was it part of wanting to rely on the open web? Was it what made you want to adopt Gutenberg? Is that also related to data consistency over time and not in the migrate stuff? I&#8217;m very curious with all the work that you do and the value brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. I think I could touch on the why Gutenberg stuff real quick and I think maybe Michael can touch on the why word WordPress stuff. I&#8217;m sure that the audience here knows why WordPress. It&#8217;s, we&#8217;re all fans of it, but at the why Gutenberg front, I think that it was just kind of, I don&#8217;t know, kismet that we were looking to redo these topic pages. We were looking to make all these big editorial changes to the site and the question was, how are we going to manage all this? How are people going to slot in these different stories to these templates and so on and so forth? I think I had gone to a word camp for publishers in Chicago-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; &#8230; a couple years back, and I really didn&#8217;t know much about Gutenberg. I knew it was coming and I really hadn&#8217;t tried it out. I think I was resistant to it. I think a lot of WordPress devs were and part of the reason I made the thread is, because I think some people still are, because it really is a complete sea change for WordPress. I&#8217;m a self-taught WordPress developer and I&#8217;m only a self-taught WordPress developer because when I started in WordPress, there were frameworks, there were guidelines, coding standards, there was the WordPress way to do things so that made it easy to get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we&#8217;re dealing with something entirely new and a completely new paradigm with blocks. So the guidelines aren&#8217;t there yet, the frameworks aren&#8217;t there yet, the Gutenberg way isn&#8217;t really well defined yet. I&#8217;m hoping that what we show here and what we give back to the community in the next couple of months as we open source more of this stuff and review more code is, we can help shape what is the Gutenberg way of doing things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi:</em> Yeah, and if-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; &#8230; yeah, it was just fortuitous that we stumbled upon it at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah. Going back to the earlier times, as I mentioned, when I got here, we were running every different type of CMS except for WordPress. And actually Russell and I at the time, did an analysis. And kudos to Russell too, because he really sort of pushed me in this direction, but it was open web, was part of it. We liked the open source ethos. We liked the fact that we weren&#8217;t getting charged a per user license or anything like that. So, a lot of it was commitment to opensource and it really was I think a really smart decision for us and it got us into the WordPress ecosystem. Then when Russell moved on and I was looking for a new developer, the community was really strong and we were able to find Seth and it just has always been a really good, a good fit for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing on the Gutenberg thing, I think Seth has been really great about, we don&#8217;t try to swallow the ocean at one time. As you pointed out, we dealt with the topic pages first and we roll out one little component of this thing to this one little portion of our site. As he mentioned, we&#8217;re about to bring a medium blog in-house and I think that&#8217;s going to be the first time we take our next big step with this full-site editing. So, really doing it incrementally is, I think, a really smart product ethos for us so that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s worked great for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: That&#8217;s really neat. It&#8217;s amazing to hear about both historically and just at the right time and working for publishers, folks should definitely check them out. I think two years ago went and talked to them about full siting, in the early, early, early days. So it&#8217;s neat to hear them mentioned as a way in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m curious too, because I know some folks have, I was talking to someone else this week who&#8217;s from Agencyland and how much the workflow has changed as people have adopted Gutenberg. I&#8217;m curious if that is the case with editors or people you&#8217;re working with, or it&#8217;s both a technology change and a workflow change. That&#8217;s the piece that I think often gets overlooked as people just talk about the technological change and mean to do things like learn JavaScript deeply or dig into blocks. But then I think there&#8217;s also a very real organizational way of how do you train people up in this new way or potentially have design look at things after the fact or before, and switching around the workflow. So I&#8217;d be curious to know what that&#8217;s been like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I was&#8230; Do you mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Go ahead definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: One thing, I actually think to be candid, I think that&#8217;s an area we&#8217;re making sure that everybody&#8217;s on the same page, it&#8217;s an area where we&#8217;re always striving to do better. There is this tension between innovation and making sure that your editors understand what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;m sure they would probably plus one on this. So I would say that it&#8217;s not something that we&#8217;ve really solved the problem. I think it&#8217;s common in most organizations like, so I think-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: You&#8217;re definitely not alone there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s one thing I think we&#8217;re aspire to is doing a better job at making sure that everybody&#8217;s up to speed as we roll stuff out, but I think we do what we can. So Seth, do you want to add to that or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; I think that that is still a struggle for us, for anyone. I was listening to a Gutenberg podcast, it might have been Gutenberg Changelog or something like that a while back. There was some guest on. I think he&#8217;s the head of Florida&#8217;s state&#8217;s web properties or something. He had mentioned that what they did when they brought on Gutenberg was, they recorded a bunch of videos and snuck it into the help menu. I thought that was really clever. That&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re going to look to do by the end of the year, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a struggle to get people to understand Gutenberg and not just the editor interface, but the concept of blocks and inner blocks and how they&#8217;ll nest together and stuff like that. We have a lot of blocks and we&#8217;ve tried a bunch of different ideas as far as interface and how you interact with these things. I think we&#8217;re finally settling on a good practice. We try to keep things in the block toolbar if you need them a lot, otherwise we hide them away in panels. There&#8217;s a fine line of when to use a block style, when should that just be a toggle on an attribute or something. That stuff&#8217;s hard to figure out and I don&#8217;t know that anyone has the right answer yet, but we&#8217;re trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So we have one question from Matt Redford and I think it touches on that. &#8220;How do you find content editors with reusable blocks? When I&#8217;ve exposed them,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;to users before the idea that it was a global element they were inserting and changing rather than something they thought they would be duplicating, caused issues.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. It has caused issues. We had&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a lot of confusion about the difference between a reusable block and a block pattern. I know there&#8217;s a ticket. It&#8217;s been pretty active the last couple days, actually on-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Actually yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; &#8230; exploring the interface for that. I think it looks like it&#8217;s heading in the right direction to me. I&#8217;m pretty excited to see if this makes it into the plugin soon, but it&#8217;s been a problem because someone will drop in a reusable block thinking that this is like a template, a block template, and they&#8217;ll edit something. Maybe that something was a post ID attribute that told that block specific information about that post and now, every single post that was using that block is referencing that one thing. That has been a problem for us. So getting people to use block patterns I think has been harder to do. People instinctively go to the reusable blocks. I&#8217;m not sure why. Maybe it&#8217;s a little bit easier to surface, but it has been a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It was also the first concept for two, for almost three years before pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Oh, right, right. We didn&#8217;t have patterns. Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi:</em> Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a UX issue right on the admin side and communicating to the end user what you&#8217;re&#8230; Yeah. I agree with Seth. It&#8217;s something where we haven&#8217;t really looked and so, and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ll note&#8230; Oh, sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I was going to say, one of the things that I&#8217;m really looking forward to tied to this is, block locking and adding the ability to disable editing and block locking specifically for the reusable block. This was actually looked into for 6.0 and did not make the cut, but it is something that is on the line because this is something that has come up a lot in the community is, the reasonable block, being able to edit in a way that is more intuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also where I think I saw you all using some block locking whenever you&#8217;re going through the demos, which is very neat. So I&#8217;m excited to see that system expand, but we have to make it intuitive for editors too. So if you limit options, it needs to make sense. I liked how you were doing that, where some of the options with the custom blocks that you have going already pick different headers and different image sizes. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting work being done there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. We&#8217;re using block locking in some situations. We&#8217;re also&#8230; I have found, it&#8217;s useful if you&#8217;re making a custom block that has a lot of inner blocks is, you can set the template, lock that, but unlock maybe some of the inner blocks that you want people to edit. I think that&#8217;s worked out pretty well actually to funnel people into how you want people to use this block. They click and say, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t change that,&#8221; you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s something that&#8230; Just with the 13.7 version of Gutenberg plugin, you can now with one toggle actually lock all the inner blocks as well. So you don&#8217;t have to go from block to block to block, but I&#8217;m now thinking about reversing a test for that to say, &#8220;Okay, what happens if I want to edit just one block? What do I have to do?&#8221; and if that block works. It&#8217;s kind of the QA person in me, that is saying, let&#8217;s see if we can go back to the original idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, but I wanted to go back to two things. Well, it&#8217;s actually one thing. So there is this whole 10 years big, great plugins that helped out a lot of people, millions of developers. One is Gravity Forms and the other one is ACF, advanced custom fields. You said you were using them, but then moved away from it. Can you dive in that a little bit more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Sure. No shade to those plugs. I mean, Gravity Forms is phenomenal as is Advanced Custom Fields. I mean, I don&#8217;t know where we would&#8217;ve been without ACF years ago, honestly, because I think the broader, Hey, WordPress needs a field&#8217;s API stuff, stuttered out after a while and there really no movement happened there because Gutenberg was coming and ACF was great. So mad props to Eliot Condon and I guess Delicious Brains now owns them. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: They&#8217;re sold to WP Engine now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Oh, okay. Wow. Yeah. So we stuck with ACF for a while into our Gutenberg transition. I think we have a few locations where it&#8217;s still being used, taxonomy term, edit page, we&#8217;re still using ACF for some fields there, but it just made sense that for all of the stuff that was in the editor screen when you&#8217;re actually editing a post or something, to go all-in on Gutenberg. That&#8217;s the whole point of what we&#8217;re doing. We are going all-in on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have this UI library with WordPress components and it felt like a shame not to use it. So almost all the stuff that originally was in ACF report materials, I showed you that in the block side bar, table of contents, child posts&#8230; We do a lot of reports, so we have one post and we&#8217;ll associate other posts as a child of that so they appear in the information architecture correctly. That&#8217;s now all happening using WordPress components and REST API and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there was no reason not to use ACF. There was no reason not to use Gravity Forms. It was just a matter of long term, we have to maintain these things. Everything you have to maintain, and it&#8217;s better, I think if we&#8217;re all-in on Gutenberg and the concept of blocks, to handle all that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you. So with ACF, moving away from just kind of thinking about, you would need to build a block about that. Then with the block, came the interfaces, well, the inspector control on the right hand side of the side bar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right. Do we have any more questions from the audience? And do you have more questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I mean, I feel like I always have more questions. I&#8217;m curious, what&#8217;s your wish? It looks like-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;ve got another two minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I know. Sure. It&#8217;s like, do you have anything that&#8217;s on your mind where maybe it&#8217;s really out there, but either current pain points or wishlist items far into the future? I&#8217;d be curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; I think a lot of them center around full-site editing and I haven&#8217;t gone deep into full site editing yet. That&#8217;s happening next month. As Michael said, we have a new sub-site we&#8217;re launching, so that we&#8217;re going to use that as an opportunity to learn about block themes and full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if there&#8217;s one wish that I would have it is, that on the PHP side of things, of core blocks, there were more filters. The query block is a good example of this. You have to intercept the whole thing. If you want to modify it, you have to intercept the whole post template block and the WP query there, which we are doing unfortunately. I would love it if you could just tap into the query arguments before they&#8217;re sent to WP query in the query loop block and modify things. So I think probably even more PHP APIs and more endpoints that we can access through PHP would be my top wish list. I think on the JavaScript side thing, I mean, whatever you want to change is there, it&#8217;s pretty easy to do. That&#8217;s probably my biggest thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I dropped in an issue if you want to. I think it&#8217;s related to what you&#8217;re talking about, because this is also&#8230; I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of agency folks that they tend to hack apart the query block and extend it for their own purposes. So it&#8217;d be neat to gather what those main requests are, see what&#8217;s going on and see what can evolve from there, what&#8217;s missing. So that&#8217;s a great one. It&#8217;s a good call out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So there is JavaScript is one change coming. I don&#8217;t know if it will really affect you, but it is on the components. They are all now refactored with TypeScript and I think it&#8217;s a big project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So to increase the developer experience because TypeScript, then your IDE taps into that and helps you with the types of the parameters and everything. So, yeah, I just wanted to tell you, this is coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; That&#8217;ll be great. We use, many years ago now, we settled on Semantic UI as a way to bootstrap our theme redevelopment efforts. We were standardizing everything under one parent theme and we went with Semantic QI. They have a great react set of components. I actually think Microsoft hired the guy who made that to lead their TypeScript team, because they&#8217;re so good. So yeah, getting all those hints and stuff while you&#8217;re typing out those components is great so I look forward to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay. So I think that&#8217;s all the time we had. It has been very, very interesting and totally inspiring to think a little bit beyond what normal websites do, especially in the news side. So at this point, I only have two more questions to all three of you. So are there any announcements that you have and couldn&#8217;t get into, because we were talking other things? The other thing is, when people want to get in touch with you, how could they? What&#8217;s the best way? Michael, did you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Michael Piccorossi</em>: I would just say I don&#8217;t really have any announcements, but if you want to get in touch with me, you can email me <a href=\"mailto:mpiccorossi@pewresearch.org\">mpiccorossi@pewresearch.org</a>. You can hit me up on Twitter. Those are the two ways to do it. If you can figure out how to spell my name from Twitter, then you can M that my last name @pewresearch, you can get to me. So thank you for having us. It&#8217;s really been enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful, wonderful. Seth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seth Rubenstein</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, you can get ahold of me on Twitter, LinkedIn, wherever I have links or might get a profile. If you&#8217;re interested in getting in touch with me, that link for that repo is in the chat so you can find that there. And yeah, thank you for having us. It&#8217;s great to show what we&#8217;ve built. We&#8217;re very proud of it. We think we&#8217;ve built a pretty rocksolid Gutenberg news publishing system and it&#8217;s cool to show it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Anne?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ll close this off. I&#8217;m just going to plug the latest call for testing the cool setting outreach program I have too. So if you&#8217;re interested in the staff and whatever stage you were in, whether you&#8217;re deep in the customizations and Gutenberg first, like these folks are, or if you&#8217;re scared to adopt feedback on all this stuff and what would make it easier is really helpful, there&#8217;s a whole outreach program designed to bring that stuff in and I would love to hear about the blockers. So I just want to nudge that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, I am not really on social media. So LinkedIn, I don&#8217;t know if that counts as social media, but I&#8217;m on LinkedIn and you can also find me at nomad.blog. There&#8217;s a contact form and I welcome people to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And for those who are on the WordPress Slack, it&#8217;s on the WordPress Slack and my name, Birgit Pauli-Haack, bph on Twitter, on Slack and also <a href=\"mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com\">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. So I don&#8217;t have an announcement either, but just my brain is really full of these great demos. I&#8217;m going to watch this probably quite a few times again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about recording, after YouTube is through the rendering, it will be on YouTube, on our Gutenberg Times channel and a big thank you to the viewers and to our panelists. It was fabulous. It&#8217;s wonderful to see that. I know there are quite a few developers on the Gutenberg team or around that are going to look for that, especially also digital strategists like Michael, to what is really possible. I think you&#8217;re really, really on the forefront on the&#8230; I&#8217;m not allowed to say that so I&#8217;m saying the leading edge of the Gutenberg development.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe. And that should help you work your way through phase two and get ready for phase three if that is where the spirit takes you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

Today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the latest Gutenberg plugin release 13.7, more template creation enhancements, full side editing themes in WooCommerce, and a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, Curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress Developer Advocate. And I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Mary Job, WordPress Community Organizer at wpafrica.org and Support Engineer at Paid Membership Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So glad you&#8217;re here again with me, Mary. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, I&#8217;m doing very okay. Thank you, Birgit. I&#8217;m also looking forward to my first WordCamp post-COVID. I believe this is also a good time to mention that a call for speakers for WordCamp Ginger is out, so if you&#8217;re interested, I look forward to meeting you there. Please apply to speak. WordCamp, again, Ginger will take place on the 2nd and 3rd of September 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Well, thank you. And I&#8217;m also so happy to welcome from Canada core team contributor and Twitch streamer, Ryan Welcher. He&#8217;s on the second time on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how are you today, Ryan? Thanks for joining us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I&#8217;m good, Birgit. Thanks for having me again. It&#8217;s always a pleasure. It was a great time last time, and I&#8217;m looking forward to diving into all the new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Excellent. You just finished this week&#8217;s live stream on Twitch. How did it go? And what did you talk about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: It went well. It was a smattering of topics. I have been working on a lot of documentation around some data store stuff, and I learned something new about useSelect, which is a hook that we use to retrieve data from Gutenberg and from the data stores. And I kind of poked around it into Gutenberg 13.7 a little bit. But we kind of ad hoc jumped into this really, this concept of one block being able to refer to another block to get its attributes and talking together and having them update and everything. And that was a lot of fun, but it was pretty in the weeds, as far as working with blocks go. But, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that sounds really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, excellent. Excellent. So. Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, yeah. I was going to say that sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome again, Ryan, and thank you for joining us on the second time here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Glad to be here. Very, very much so. Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: All right. So, let&#8217;s get this show on the road. We have a couple of announcements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, I&#8217;m glad to announce that Pattern Previews are now available in the Team Directory. Now, the Meta Team has released a better version of this new future in a team directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this does is, it allows you to see the patterns that are available within a team. The patterns at the space are thumbnails on the team stage. And when you click on them, you can see a larger version, which is what you would also see when you click on a page on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a first iteration, and in the release post on the Meta Team blog, Steven Dufresne different as asks for feedback. So, if you&#8217;re testing this and you see something that is not working right, please, please do give them a feedback so that they can improve more on this future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any thoughts on this, Ryan or Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, I find it&#8217;s really fantastic that it&#8217;s out there. And yeah, because I suspect that patterns will become so much more important on WordPress than they are now. And this is another example of how patterns will get a much bigger exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Awesome. Okay. All right. Still on announcements, next up, there is a call for comments on a feature plugin for notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m actually excited about this one. I don&#8217;t know if I have OCD or something, but it freaks me out when I enter into a WordPress site and I&#8217;m seeing all this notifications there and there I&#8217;m just clicking X and X, and then I come back and I see them. It&#8217;s really upsetting. So, actually, this is not block- or editor-related, but the group of contributors working on this review for the API, for the BP admins just published this in their current approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the problem this seeks to address is actually simple. Imagine you log into your WebPress site. You haven&#8217;t been there for weeks. And the moment you do, you&#8217;re bombarded with update notifications, premium plugin advertisements. I think the one that gets me is the premium plugin advertisements that come on the main dashboard instead of on the plugin itself dashboard. I mean, when I see them, like, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; So this is what the team around the WP notification project tries to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting from the post by Brian Coords, it says, &#8220;This project is focused on building a new framework for notifications from the ground up, and potentially providing a tool that encourages consistency in presentation, follows best practices in standards and accessibility, and discourages disruptive interactions in the WordPress admin screen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have thoughts on this, Ryan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I love it. I love the idea of it. I know it&#8217;s the bane of most site owners&#8217; existence to deal with the&#8230; Every plugin handles notifications differently. I mean, when people are left to sort of roll their own solution to a problem, then we get 100,000 different solutions, so having something that&#8217;s standard, and it&#8217;s thoughtful, and built from the ground up, it&#8217;s going to be great. Because I just think we can&#8230; Well, even the most obtrusive notifications with a system like that will still not be that obtrusive, and not be that glaring. It won&#8217;t be bright orange or whatever it is, all those sort of horrible UX decisions that get made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything really bad that can come out of a proposal like this, in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Sorry. Go on-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; totally. I agree totally. After 19 years, I think it would be really&#8230; It&#8217;s good to have a team looking at it, and the team has been working on this for a few years now, on and off, because&#8230; Yeah, some of us have life outside of WordPress. But, yeah. I&#8217;m glad they got to the next step in showing the world what they&#8217;re up to. And that is always good because now feedback comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially also, for the planning developers, because admin notices are important. Yeah, but what are the importance of this, and how would you work it if you&#8217;re a plug-in developer as well? So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Awesome. I look forward to testing it and giving you my own feedback on how it works. So, yeah. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, moving forward to our section on community contributions. First up, I&#8217;m happy to let you know that the first block teams are now available in the WooCommerce marketplace. This is exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re building Woocom masters, Bonum by Themes Kingdom was the first. This particular one favors a great set of patterns for all kinds of sellers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one also just landed, and it&#8217;s called Basti by Ana Segota of Honorary Design. As always, this one shows off a beautiful design, and it has great attention to detail. It also provides wonderful patterns, and also some great style variations for your buttons, columns, and other books. It also has some great overall style variations that would let you change the character of the theme. On installation, you would find a set of four design variations, depending on the nature of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie Marsland is a review of this particular team. So if you&#8217;re building newcomer sites often, you should also take a look and explore this block teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, Jamie Marsland did a review, an eight-minute review of it, and really did a deep dive into it. And I was always wondering, yeah, with the block themes, what would make a theme, the value that of cost? Yeah, what would I pay for when I buy a theme that is full-site editing, and it&#8217;s definitely the style variations for my buttons, or for every block, or/and it&#8217;s also the style variations for the global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, of course, the nature of the patterns, and how they fit into the versatility of the theme. So, I think this is very well, both themes, the Basti theme, as well as the Bonum theme in the Bonum marketplace. It pretty much says it all in the marketplace announced there are free themes in there, but those two are not free themes. There are both premium things, just to do a little caveat there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 13.7</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, that brings us to our what&#8217;s releases section, and we released yesterday or the Gutenberg team released yesterday, on Wednesday 20th, the Gutenberg 13.7. Yeah, Gutenberg 13.7 brings an updated model design. And we&#8217;ll talk about the features later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this release comes 167 PRs with 58 contributors, including four first-time contributors. So, excellent. Kudos to all the contributors who helped with the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Sorry. I just want to say that it&#8217;s been fairly recently, I think, in the release post that we&#8217;ve been specifically calling out first-time contributors. I think it&#8217;s probably not that recent, but I think that&#8217;s phenomenal. I know when I was first trying to get my first core props, it&#8217;s just such a win. It&#8217;s such a huge win, and you feel so good. And it&#8217;s great that people are calling, that they&#8217;re getting mentioned every two weeks, as opposed to every six months, or three months, I guess, when the next version of WordPress comes out. I just think it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s such a good way of thanking people that are putting in their time to get this done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways, sorry. Continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you want to know who the new contributors are, check out the release post because, on the low end, after the Changelog, you&#8217;ll see who they are and what did they contribute? So, you can see also, is it something that you would want to do? Or just thank them personally when you know them, or when you see them in Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there are a few enhancements in that release. One is the update of the model design and it&#8217;s subtle, but it&#8217;s very, very helpful because it provides you focus on what you might want to accomplish because it blurs the background. It kind of comes up on top of the page, and then blurs the background a little bit. It also reduces visual noise in the corners. So, it&#8217;s definitely a quality-of-life enhancements, as we call it. But it&#8217;s definitely something that will replicate through all the models. So, it&#8217;s the preferences, it&#8217;s the keyboard shortcut, it&#8217;s the&#8230; Or any other model that&#8217;s kind of in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the theme developers, the next one is&#8230; You will really find that helpful, but now there&#8217;s text decoration support for the post title block, which was still missing, especially when you do for query blocks or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, there&#8217;s also now a change in the featured image. No, in the media placeholder. Now, if you use an image block or a cover block in a post, you can actually say you want to use the featured image, so you don&#8217;t have to reload it up again into the post, if it&#8217;s a featured image, and if your theme doesn&#8217;t show it already with your single post. And in the query blocks, you now can use them in your templates and you just have one click where you can select the featured image. You could do it before, but you had to click twice in the toolbar to actually attach the featured image to that block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, Mary, Ryan, if you have anything, yeah? Feel free to comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, I think that kind of changed just to make it easier to do something, like two clicks doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot, but if you&#8217;re building out hundreds of pages, two clicks ends up being a lot of time, right? So, being able to reduce even down one click, it&#8217;s nice. I think it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, it&#8217;s half the time, right? And it&#8217;s not always two clicks. It&#8217;s also that you have to move them out to find the click, yeah. So now, that is all much nicer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar redesign was made also for the document settings. That&#8217;s on the sidebar, not the block settings, but the post settings for post or page settings for the page. So, in the previous releases, the post settings panel in the side bar was already redesigned. And in this release, it all becomes a little bit more refined. So, the fields for post format, slug, template, and authors are now aligned, and they all have the same width.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the template displays the default template string instead of none, so it opens up the dropdown box to select the new one, or edit the existing one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the perma link opens now. If you want to change it into a pop-over to edit it, and it&#8217;s a much nicer experience than trying to fit it into the small screen there when you want to re-edit the slug. So, the result is cleaner. It&#8217;s more organized, and should help to readily access the important information about the post and page at a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I&#8217;m just going to say, again, these kind of changes just make&#8230; They&#8217;re all quality-of-life changes, right? It doesn&#8217;t really matter to your website if all those things align, but it&#8217;s some visual dissonance, and stuff like that. So, yeah. It&#8217;s nice to be able to….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; to refine these things as we move forward, as the project move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Totally agree. And when you look at the release post, and there is&#8230; The design team put two images together, and the web episode org side has a compare block where you can have before-and-after pictures. And then you have a slider in the middle of it, and you can slide along. That&#8217;s in there, but for this one, you just see the two sidebars next to each other. And it&#8217;s so weird, yeah? I&#8217;ve never noticed how disjointed it actually was before than it is. And now that it&#8217;s in order, yeah, it&#8217;s so much nicer to look at. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and now we come to the bigger feature. The biggest feature that&#8217;s actually in the release is that you now can create templates for all kinds of different post types, different taxonomies, specific terms, specific categories on tags for authors. You can even create a custom general template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when you add or edit a template for custom post types and taxonomies, you can do it for a single post. So, you get a list, for the single custom post-type pages that you can select and then edit or create a new one, if your theme hasn&#8217;t provided them, because you just created your own custom post type with a plugin or something like that. You see it in the Add New Template for it. So, that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you can, for instance, have a different template on your blog. You can have it for personal blogs. Blog post, you have a different template than for a developer-related blog post, or a third one for travel posts. So, you can do a lot more creativity here. And if you have custom post types, as I said, it&#8217;s already automatically in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I already got a question on Twitter after I tweeted out the new features about the new plugin. And there was a question, &#8220;So, how do I get an archive post type? So, is there an archive for my books? If my post type is books, can I have an archive?&#8221; You can, but not with the template engine yet. You can certainly do a new page and pull in the query block, which already covers the custom post types. But that is the only template that has not been yet created. It&#8217;s in the works. I saw the tracking issue for all the different templates that developers want to create, and that one is the only one that doesn&#8217;t have a checkbox. It was pretty interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s pretty big because without….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: It&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; access&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8230; For theme developers or anyone, really, who&#8217;s building block themes, this is massive. Because one of the things that I&#8217;ve heard is the&#8230; When it first came out, we couldn&#8217;t do&#8230; We can&#8217;t create the theme templating system that WordPress has had since, I don&#8217;t know, Version 1 on the PHP side, in the full-site editing experience, until now, basically. Right? So it&#8217;s huge because there are so many times where just having that specific template that you want to have for a very specific thing meant that you had to go and create a new file in your theme, upload that to your server, or whatever. And then, you could work with it. But now, I mean, it&#8217;s going to put a bunch of developers out of work. I mean, it&#8217;s not. I&#8217;m kidding. But a lot of that, it&#8217;s not completely in the hands of the admin, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. And yeah, for those who design themes, it&#8217;s definitely, you don&#8217;t need to have access to the final theme file system anymore. Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And you don&#8217;t need to know about the template hierarchy that WordPress has because it kind of gives you a clear jumping point for the next block template that you want to create. So, it definitely expands the reach of the creativity or template editing beyond just the developer. Yeah, I really love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next step for that would be custom fields, right? How to-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; surface custom fields and custom post templates. Yeah. So, it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see what will be next for WordPress and the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I don&#8217;t know if this is in the works, but I just recently built a site for a friend of mine. And there was a lot of&#8230; It would be great if you could create a template that was inherited from an existing template. Maybe there&#8217;s a way of doing it. I haven&#8217;t really dived into it that far, but I can see that being something that people want to do. Like I create a new template for a very specific tag. I don&#8217;t want to have to go and set my header in my footer again. I just want to inherit that from whatever, from a template. So, if anyone&#8217;s listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: That&#8217;s what you should do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it&#8217;s geniuses all kind of think alike. So, there is actually an issue in the GitHub repo, or at least it&#8217;s talked about that those templates shouldn&#8217;t start from scratch on a blank page. They should have some default, be it the header and footer in there so it kind of starts out like a page on my site and not so much, &#8220;Okay. What is missing here?&#8221; Yeah, kind of thing. Because the surprise would be that if it&#8217;s a white blank page, and you just put the things in that you want, it won&#8217;t have a header and footer right now, but that is definitely in the works. Yeah, you&#8217;re absolutely…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Which I think would be great, yeah. Because I think the path of least resistance is where 90% of the people are&#8230; That&#8217;s 90% of the use cases. I just want a new tag template, so I don&#8217;t want to have to go and reset up my whole page. If I want all that, then I probably wouldn&#8217;t have any problem saying, &#8220;Copy this template,&#8221; and then changing the things that I need, as opposed to brand new template. And I got to rebuild all things, and maybe I have to match settings and stuff. Anyways. It sounds like it&#8217;s definitely on the radar, which is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It is, yeah. I don&#8217;t know how the implementation will look, but there&#8217;s definitely, yeah , the GitHub space. You listeners, if you want to do some input, there&#8217;s always great discussions on GitHub on how to approach a feature like that, that hasn&#8217;t been done before. And that&#8217;s actually the beauty of community, yeah, that more people have better ideas, and it comes out of better product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Another quality-of-life, so to speak, or a start of a new feature is in the Information Panel on the Editor. That&#8217;s the little eye circle. Now has received a new number, and that&#8217;s the estimated time to read in the Table of Contents in the Editor. So, next to the numbers of words and characters and numbers of blocks, numbers of headings, numbers of paragraphs, the sixth one is now estimated time to read for whatever this asset is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I really like that because then you can kind of gauge, &#8220;Am I too long now?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Do I need to put a TLDR on top of it because it&#8217;s now longer than two minutes?&#8221; Or something like that. Yeah, you can kind of build your own rules around this. Not rules, but kind of think about your own rules, yeah. Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah. You can also copy that instead of using a plugin, add a plugin to your site to do that. You can just copy and put Estimated reading time at the top of all your posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, of course, it would also be better. So, it&#8217;s only displayed in the Editor right now, and it cannot be used on the front end without additional feature. But I put in a feature request for a new post, Time to Read block in GitHub. So chime in, if you want to, and kind of have a bubble up. It would be one of the new blocks for a post, and that you can use in a query block or even on a single a post template, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s kind of for the enhancements. We&#8217;re quite a few&#8230; Not the big swings, but they are apart from the huge amount of templates that you can create now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: There&#8217;s one that we skipped over from full-site editing, Birgit, that I just wanted to call out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; Apply to the block locking that applies to air blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh. Yes, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I think that&#8217;s fantastic. Was it 5.9 that released that block locking came out? Or was it 6.0. I can&#8217;t remember. But the ability to go in and lock a block, and now you can apply that to any of its children blocks, which I think it&#8217;s a huge quality-of-life thing, which is so nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Because that&#8217;s a lot of work, especially if you have nested blocks and nested blocks and nested blocks, you have to go in to every single one and mark them and lock them, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Now you have just a little toggle switch on the bottom of-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; the module, and where you say, &#8220;Apply to all blocks in this container.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: So, that could extend the patterns, which would be great, because you could probably have your patterns start out as locked. And there&#8217;s a lot of options here. Block locking&#8217;s a really powerful tool, especially when you get into user-based block locking where, as a administrator, I have access to all the blocks, but as, say an editor, I can&#8217;t move two or three of those blocks. When you get into that level of editorial control, especially across a team, it gets super, super powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And we will later on also talk a little bit about the new handbook page about that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>APIs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, bug fixes. Oh, we had one new API, which I find quite interesting. From my perspective, it&#8217;s JavaScript arrow tracking, and it allows a custom error reporting logic to be called. And then, the error boundaries kind of&#8230; It kind of bubbles up to the front end or to wherever you want it, but it is not suppressed by the block editor. So it definitely very helpful when you&#8217;re debugging things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know anything more about that? Or any comments?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s super powerful. I think one thing that, as a block developer, errors are problematic because they&#8217;re hard to track. They&#8217;re hard to track down. So, if you&#8217;ve ever seen this sort of Cannot Display Block and An Error Occurred, that&#8217;s the error boundary. So basically, the way the react works is it&#8217;s wrapping every error, and it catches it all and says An Error Happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what this API allows you to do is, when that error happens, you can actually do something with the error message. One of the examples in the pull request is, if you were going to Century, Century I/O, I think it is. It&#8217;s an error logging tool, right? So if you had a block that was, say, hitting an API that you wrote or whatever, and you wanted to log errors back to Century to be able to see what happened, this enables that. This allows you to do really complicated things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or even if you just wanted to, say, fire a notice, and say, &#8220;Hey, you didn&#8217;t input your API key. That&#8217;s why this failed,&#8221; that helps to give your user a better indication of why their block failed. Now, hopefully, you shouldn&#8217;t be having a block fail in the wild, sort of thing. But sometimes we need certain things to be in place before these blocks will work. But I&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s the beginning of a lot more developer experience, style of quality-of-life changes, things that allow the developers building these blocks to be able to handle things more gracefully, specifically errors. Especially&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t know. I think it&#8217;s really, really good. It&#8217;s super interesting to me, but I&#8217;m a big developer nerd, so I think it&#8217;s&#8230; I don&#8217;t know a lot of use cases for it right now, but I can definitely see it growing. As it matures, it&#8217;ll be more and more useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, there were quite a few bug fixes coming out of it, but I think that there was none that actually jumped out at me and said, &#8220;Oh, thank God that it&#8217;s fixed now,&#8221; kind of thing. But, of course it&#8217;s also&#8230; Yeah. It&#8217;s in the&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s every personal experience is a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But we come to the documentation settings. And Ryan, you have done quite some work there to enhance or make the documentation better through the Generation Tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s always been a bit of a pet peeve of mine that the Block Editor Handbook has got a lot of information, and it&#8217;s great. And it&#8217;s all generated dynamically directly from the Gutenberg repository. But there&#8217;s not a lot of code examples. And, specifically in the data store realm, there&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; You can see what is available to you, but using it is sometimes a lot more complicated than just, say, making a call to a function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of what I&#8217;ve been working on is the ability to&#8230; Well, adding all examples for as many packages as I can. We have examples now for the Get Notices package, so you can use those. The other part that I&#8217;m working on is removing things from the documentation that probably shouldn&#8217;t be there for an end user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this is a bit in the weeds, but when you&#8217;re dealing with data stores specifically Redux-based data stores, which is what Gutenberg is basing its data stores on, you have these functions called Actions, and some are only dispatched or run internally to the store. So the store says, &#8220;Get me a thing,&#8221; and then that thing gets returned. And then the store internally says, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got that thing. Now I could do something else with it.&#8221; So those actions aren&#8217;t ever going to be used by a developer using a public API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one of the things that I&#8217;ve been working on is adding a support for a doc block tag that will basically exclude things from the documentation. And so, that&#8217;s a big win, I think for us, because it&#8217;s already complicated and the functions don&#8217;t really explain what they do, and they shouldn&#8217;t be used at all because you would never call them. It wouldn&#8217;t make any sense. And if you did call them, it&#8217;d probably just break the data store. So that&#8217;s one thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, another thing that I&#8217;ve been working on is&#8230; Actually, I guess that&#8217;s it. They ignore stuff. Getting examples in, I just literally merged half an hour ago a PR that gets rid of all of the internal actions for the data package, which is great. So it&#8217;s going to reduce the amount of documentation, but make it more concise. But, yeah. It&#8217;s a long process. There&#8217;s like 10 packages and there&#8217;s a lot of selectors and actions that I have to document.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if anyone wants to help, there&#8217;s a tracking ticket in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; all of our sections, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ll find that for you. And we&#8217;ll share the tracking issue link in the show notes, so you can jump on board. It could also be quite interesting too, because that gets you a little bit into the weeds, but not deep enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I will tell you this; you will know the package inside out and backwards, because you have to write documents. You have to write examples that work. You have to figure out how they work, and then you have to figure out a real reason to use it. I know lots about this now, way more than I ever thought I would, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: So, it was a great way to get right into the API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I wanted to also&#8230; So, thank you for doing that, picking up on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: No problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And going through with it. What I also found on the documentation, how it&#8217;s also part of the documentation revamp, or more people looking at documentation from a point of developer experience, or is that we might reorganize things. Yeah, so having a different header or a different pass to a certain document, or even the document URLs changes. But we need to have a redirect directly attached to it, so we can say, &#8220;Okay, this old page now needs to redirect to the new page,&#8221; so we don&#8217;t lose people that have been in that documentation for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, I connected with the Mater Team and figure out how can this be done on the Gutenberg manifest, the JSON repo. Yeah, to also add the redirect later on, so when they import it to, when the importer, into the webpress.org pages, then also can take care of those redirects directly, and not have a second step to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I think that&#8217;s great. I think that&#8217;s going to allow us&#8230; Us, the Royal us. Is that a thing to-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; to be more fluid with the docs because I know that&#8217;s been&#8230; Our docs&#8230; If you look at some of these pages, they&#8217;re massive. They&#8217;re just super long, and there&#8217;s that there&#8217;s that zero to expert problem that we sort of have in the documentation realm where, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a basic example, and now here&#8217;s all the information you&#8217;ll ever need to know about it ever.&#8221; And it&#8217;s all kind of on the same page. And so, if by being able to be more dynamic with how often we change pages, and we can set redirects and things, it&#8217;ll allow us to kind of play with the documentation format, and maybe we can be a bit more. We can play a bit more fast and loose with it and try things. And it&#8217;s not a huge undertaking, and people don&#8217;t lose all their bookmarks, and it&#8217;s bad times. So I think it&#8217;s great, being able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I wanted to bring it back to what you talked about before, the locking experience for&#8230; There is a new page in the Block Editor Developer Handbook, and that is called Curating the Editor Experience. And you&#8217;ll find it under the How To Guides. And it talks about the locking API, what the user can do, and how you can suppress that, and how you lock patterns or templates, how you can set the permissions, change the permissions to the control-locking ability with code examples. Very well done. And providing default controls and options in the theme JSON file, and how to find how to work that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also, to limit the interface options to the Theme JSON. That&#8217;s the global styles kind of on the right-hand side. Yeah, you don&#8217;t&#8230; not necessarily want somebody to use the custom color or to use the custom doer tone links because you want to stay on design color, on brand color, all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a make blog post about it, but now it&#8217;s in the handbook and it&#8217;s&#8230; If I look through it, I find it really comprehensive. And it has some nice section adders, and additional resources that are also on the Learn. So there is one video on the WP space from the Learn Worker space. It&#8217;s working with templates and full-set editing. And, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a great page, and that is new. And yeah, I love that it&#8217;s now all in one place and not distributed over the whole web universe, because somebody found something and shared it. But then, yeah, I can do that, but I also want to lock down this, so now you have it all on one page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There are a few experiments that are called, globally, the style engine, and there were some updates there. I will share the style engine tracking issue. And there&#8217;s also a block layout tracking issue for that. So you can stay up to date in what it&#8217;s all about. It&#8217;s pretty much how styles are treated from theme to block, to elements, and back again, in terms of how you can change things, yeah. Because, for some of the things you have UI, and for some of them, it&#8217;s only in Theme Jason. Some of them, you need to still do with CSS. So, there&#8217;s quite a big work to be done to standardize that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s it. Do have anything else that you&#8230; Oh, yeah! That was the first idea that I had when I thought about getting Ryan on the show. There&#8217;s a section in the grade block about the grade block script. And that is that you get a prompt for minimum system requirements, if they are not met. And also, careful prompts to, yeah, how to continue with that. And it also fixes a regression from the size, underscore size refactoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, great block. Ryan, you have done quite a few demos, and quite some work on it. What does it do for those who haven&#8217;t heard about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Well, it&#8217;s my favorite package in all WordPress, first of all. What it does is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And now, we get into the second hour of our podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; easier a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Do you have a minute?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Do you have an hour and a half?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I have a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Okay. Sit down. Let me tell you about Create Block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is, basically, the TLDR is that it is the tool that allows you to quickly scaffold blocks. So it will create a plugin, and it will create for you a block, a scaffolded, simple block that you can then do whatever you want with. So it&#8217;s very, very powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can accept custom templates. You can write your own templates and publish them. The NPM, you can use local templates. So if you have a very specific way that you like to build your blocks, or work for an agency, and your agency&#8217;s got a very specific way, you can create a template and have the Create Block package just refer to that template, and it&#8217;ll build blocks out for you however you like. It&#8217;s super powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the two pull requests that are in there around a prompting, there are some edge cases when it comes to, I think it&#8217;s Linux, and maybe a bit of Windows, that for where we were getting some false positives. When you run Create Block, what it does behind the scenes is it checks to make sure you have the right version of, know the right version of all these things installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes, depending on the platform, it would say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not right. You&#8217;re missing,&#8221; and whatever, and it would just stop, so you couldn&#8217;t use it. So, what this is allowing you to do is it&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve got the right things. Do you want to still go?&#8221; And if you know that you do indeed have everything you need, you can continue the process. It makes it a lot easier, because it&#8217;s a huge blocker for someone that&#8217;s not maybe working on the most sort of standard system set-up, that they can&#8217;t use this tool, even though they know they&#8217;ve got it set up the way they want it, and that it&#8217;s set up correctly and it will work, that the tool fails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s what this is all about. Just allowing us&#8230; Well, it just drives adoption. It just allows more people to use the tool. The last one, the fixing the regression from size, there was a internal effort to move away from Lodash, I believe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. _.size is a Lodash function. So this, it was moved away from using Lodash, but then they found that there was a regression, so they fixed it, and that&#8217;s all that was. But-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it is, actually…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; dependencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; a huge effort to move away from Lodash for performance reasons. And if you count in the change lock all the PRs together that are listed, you will not get to 167. You will only get to 120 or 30 because there were about 40 different PRs that touched quite a few files to move away from Lodash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. Which I think makes sense. I mean, if we don&#8217;t need it. I don&#8217;t know if Lodash&#8230; I don&#8217;t know which&#8230; There&#8217;s a Lodash that sort of allows tree-shaking and one that does not, and I don&#8217;t know which one we&#8217;re using. And so, leads to large bundle sizes, and all sorts of bad times in the JavaScript world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I wanted to&#8230; Create Block is also my favorite tool, and I just wanted…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; to add many people tried it out before, and they were only kind of fixated on single blocks. But now you can have&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s already implemented. I know you were working on it to allow for multi blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Multi blocks? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is actually built into the Scripts package, so you don&#8217;t need to have a special template. And so, originally, you needed to have a special template and a special Webpack file that would allow you to build a multiple blocks using a single-build process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, myself and Greg, who&#8217;s an alumni of Gutenberg changelog. We worked really hard on working on scripts and Create Block to allow scripts by default to handle multiple blocks. It wasn&#8217;t just us. There was a lot of people, and Greg did all the heavy lifting. I&#8217;m just taking credit for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, if you, if you structure your setup in a certain way, basically putting a block that JSON file inside of a directory inside of your source files, your source directory, the Scripts Package will see it and it will create a block for each one of those that it finds. So we don&#8217;t need anything custom to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we are doing with Create Block, and this is hopefully going to get in soon, is we are trying to make it so you can just scaffold the block, so when you run Create Block now it will scaffold an entire plugin, and then put a block inside that plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we want to be able to do is have it scaffold the plugin, and then if you run it a second time with a flag, it&#8217;ll only just add another plugin to your existing one. And that&#8217;s-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to add a lot of power to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: And we&#8217;re sort of working on that now. And we&#8217;re also working on the ability to of, within this, we could do a whole nother podcast on this, so I&#8217;ll stop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Maybe we should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; a lot of cool&#8230; Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of really cool things coming for both scripts and Create Block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I also know there is a flag that you can set when you create it that it&#8217;s going to be a dynamic block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, sure. That&#8217;s not merged yet, but that is-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; the other one. Because we are working on making that as simple as possible, there has been talk of, instead of it being dynamic block, it would be like dash dash variation. And then you can tell it&#8217;s static or dynamic, or if there&#8217;s another type that gets introduced along the way. We can do that as well. So, we&#8217;re still working on that. It&#8217;s definitely something that I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s could going to say no to. It&#8217;s just a matter of making sure that we get it right before it launches, because it&#8217;s really hard to change something after it&#8217;s out in the world. So, yeah. So, there&#8217;s a few things that Greg and I have been working on, that I think is going to hopefully make Create Block the defacto package for building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome, yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: That&#8217;s my pitch. That&#8217;s my elevator pitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Very good. And this was a great segue into our What&#8217;s an Active Development were discussed. And one is that I mentioned about documentation be restructuring. And we mentioned Greg. So Greg has gone in and has looked at the hooks references for the Block Editor and found that the documentation is using the term hook filters differently than the rest of the WordPress documentation. Because there are hooks with actions and filters, not just filters. So, he wanted to restructure the reference for that. And he has. The only thing, he hasn&#8217;t changed the name on the titles yet. He has changed the page title, but not the slugs because we discovered we needed a redirect thing. So this was merged. It&#8217;s in the handbook now, but the slug does not match the title of the page, which sometimes a little unfortunate. But that&#8217;s definitely updated. It will come, and it&#8217;s already in the handbook because the handbook updates are not tied to the release. Yeah, they are listed in the release notes just to have them, give them a place, but they are, pretty much as soon as the PR is merged into Gutenberg, within 15 minutes, the documentation page is updated. So, that&#8217;s actually a great process here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: It&#8217;s great. But it can also be a little bit&#8230; And this is probably something that we can talk about. But because it&#8217;s built from Trunk. Trunk is the bleeding edge of everything that&#8217;s in Gutenberg. And since, sometimes, things end up in documentation that aren&#8217;t released in Core and aren&#8217;t released in any plugin versions. And there&#8217;s no sort of simple way right now of indicating that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; But it is awesome that when documentation gets up&#8230; Like I merged my poll request just before we started, and it&#8217;s already live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: The doc changes are already there, and that&#8217;s great. But, yeah. So that&#8217;s something to keep in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s not a version control. It&#8217;s just a bleeding edge and it also doesn&#8217;t disseminate between what&#8217;s in WordPress and what&#8217;s just available in plugin and future WordPress. So, yeah. It&#8217;s sometimes we need to kind of read it a little bit carefully, especially when you are an early adopter of things and love that life on the bleeding edge. Yeah, sometimes it gets you there bloody, yeah. Oh, leading edge. Not that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that&#8217;s in the works is, and a lot of people definitely have been waiting for it. It&#8217;s the fluid typography. So, the first iteration is already merged, and will come to 13.8. It&#8217;s still experimental, but for theme developers only in theme JSON to have the settings for the fluid typography. So, they set minimum and maximum sizes for the font, and then it automatically expands and&#8230; Or is it expands and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What&#8217;s the other one, word?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Contracts. Yeah, not a D. It was of long wrong. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if all is good, you can test it with Gutenberg Nightly already. Or you wait for the Gutenberg 13.8 coming out on August 3rd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Smith, who was, I guess, here on the Episode 68, he is experimenting with a feature to actually attach custom labeling to blocks in the list view. And that has come up quite repeatedly in the call for on the FSE program, and also in the user testing that when you have more group blocks in your page, that it&#8217;s hard to kind of find the one that you actually want to work on. And because they&#8217;re all called group blocks, and you have six or seven of them, or three of them, you hit them no say, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not it. That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; yeah. But if you can give them a name, then you can identify them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same is with headings or even with paragraphs, yeah. You can kind of, each of them. It&#8217;s not merged yet. It&#8217;s a PR that you can&#8230; And I&#8217;ll link it in the show notes that you can maybe even test out there. And it just gives you&#8230; You click into the block row where the block is mentioned, and then it opens up an editing field that you can write in, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I think this feature&#8230; I think it&#8217;s very cool. First of all, it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s needed to be able to&#8230; If you&#8217;re in the list view and you&#8217;ve got 20 blocks, and it&#8217;s hard to know what&#8217;s what. But a side effect of this, which is something that actually just came up in my livestream today, when we were trying&#8230; I think I said this earlier&#8230; But we were trying to have one block refer to another block, and get its attributes, and then do something with those attributes in the first block. And the issue that we were running into was, there&#8217;s no unique identifier for blocks that are persistent. So, they&#8217;re in the bowels of the code. There is a Client ID that you can get access to, but that Client ID is refreshed every page load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So having something like this, a really cool side effect is that now we&#8217;ve got a unique identifier for a block. So you can give the block a name, and then that&#8230; Because in the implementation, I believe they&#8217;re saving it as a block attribute, so it gets saved with the block. So now, other blocks can get that block by getting the list of blocks and filtering by that attribute for the thing that they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that that&#8230; I mean, this is a perfect case of we built for one thing, but now there&#8217;s a whole nother use case that people can really use it for. And I&#8217;m super excited about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I will-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; I will help Dave with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; And it probably would be helpful to keep that in mind when the first iteration comes out. Yeah, how that can be used in plugins or in&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;ve already-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Or because it&#8217;s…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; left a comment on the PRs. Yeah, it&#8217;s so powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But it&#8217;s-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: The user…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but it&#8217;s user controlled, so the plugin doesn&#8217;t know what the user going to do. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: That&#8217;s true. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, it&#8217;s-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I mean, in the use case that I&#8217;m talking about, it&#8217;s sort of you would need to have that user level to connect those two things anyways. But it solves the development problem of, &#8220;How do I make a connection between two blocks when I have no unique identifier anywhere to save as a reference?&#8221; There&#8217;s no Block ID that&#8217;s persistent. It&#8217;s always new every page load. But this could potentially solve a problem like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; cases around the same name. What do you do with the same name? But that sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. All of that. Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: And it&#8217;s very cool, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, it&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s experimental and it&#8217;s relatively new. We don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to be merged or when it&#8217;s coming through the Gutenberg Nightly, but that&#8217;s kind of that a little PR bleeding edge or leading edge, sorry. I need to kind of get the bleeding out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is pretty much the end of our Changelog today. So, Mary and Ryan, is there anything that you want the community to know or remind them of, before we end the show so they can kind of look out for it, or see you, or&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Well, I&#8217;m going to shamelessly self-promote. You can watch me every Thursday at 10:30 Eastern at on Twitch. My handle&#8217;s Ryan Welcher Codes. I&#8217;ve also got the YouTube channel with the same name, Ryan Welcher Codes. So, anything on my stream, that&#8217;s anything that&#8217;s decent, I usually put on YouTube. And, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, we do all kinds of coding stuff, usually block-related. So, that&#8217;s my shameless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: &#8230; self-promotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, super. And we&#8217;ll put, of course, the links in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Well, on my end, I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. And I like what Ryan did. You know what they say. They say, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t promote yourself, nobody&#8217;s going to do it for you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. So&#8230; And before we end the show, I just wanted to remind you, dear listener, that if you like the change of podcast and of&#8230; Write us a review, either on Stitcher or on Apple or on Google. It helps us promote it and kind of get more people interested in it, and they know that it&#8217;s around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, as always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is episode 70.

Marsland also highlight three new block themes from the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a considerably deeper dive into the matters of creating templates for FSE, <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/21/core-editor-improvement-deeper-customization-with-more-template-options/\"><strong>Deeper customization with more template options</strong></a>.

The second Block Theme, called <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/basti/\">Basti by Ana Segota of Anariel Design</a> landed this week. It shows off beautiful designs, shows great attention to detail by the designer, provides some wonderful patterns and also some great block styles for your buttons, columns other blocks. From a selection of elaborate style variations, you change the character of your site without changing your theme. On installation, you’ll find a set of four designs depending on the nature or industry of your business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his video, Jamie Marsland gives you a detailed tour of the theme and shine a light on all the little details that make this theme so great. Marsland called it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFqdHZco1Cg\"><strong>The most beautiful WordPress Gutenberg Block Theme</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgardner/status/1550556360064081920\">Brian Gardner</a></strong> tweeted: &#8220;Without question, Basti by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ana_Segota\">@Ana_Segota</a> + <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnarielDesign\">@AnarielDesign</a> is one of the most beautiful FSE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hashtag_click\">#WordPress</a> themes. (Easily better than anything I have designed.)&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ana Segota</strong> published the <a href=\"https://www.anarieldesign.com/demos/?theme=Basti\">demo site </a>for your perusal. Give it whirl. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Dufresne</strong> announced the new beta feature: <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/07/21/pattern-previews-for-themes-in-the-directory-beta/\">Pattern Previews for Themes&nbsp;in the Directory</a>.</strong> Users can now browse the pattern via the thumbnails on the single Theme page. The first feedback reveals that only patterns using core blocks will be displayed. Patterns that include references to 3rd party blocks won&#8217;t be visible in the Theme Directory in this first version. It&#8217;s also unlikely that they ever will. It would require for the meta time to install  all the possible 3rd party block plugins on the Theme Directory site. That is very unlikely. </p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/archeo/\"><img /></a><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/archeo/\">Pattern display for the Theme: Archeo</a>\n\n\n\n<p>In her post on the Make Design blog: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/07/19/proposal-a-new-kind-of-default-theme/\">Proposal: A new kind of default theme</a>, <strong>Channing Ritter</strong> suggests a more collaborative approach to building the next WordPress default theme Twenty-Twenty-Three. The design and theme team will work together on a base theme,  and once it&#8217;s available for further development, community designers will be able to submit Style variations. The teams will then select some to be included into the default theme. The process is not quite refined. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/raemoreywrites\"><strong>Rae Morey</strong></a> of <em>The Repository</em> wrote in <a href=\"https://www.therepository.email/?mailpoet_router&endpoint=view_in_browser&action=view&data=WzE1NCwiOTBjZDMxZDFmYWU3Iiw1NTYsIjFqb2g0ZGtiNnZmbzh3NG9vb3dnNG9zODhnazA0czR3IiwzNTYsMF0\">Issue 132</a>:  &#8220;Responses to Ritter&#8217;s proposal have been overwhelmingly positive with designers and developers—including&nbsp;Brian Gardner&nbsp;(designer and Principal Developer Advocate at&nbsp;WP Engine),&nbsp;Rich Tabor&nbsp;(Product Manager at&nbsp;Extendify), and&nbsp;Anariel Design—indicating their eagerness to participate.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his article, <strong><a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/create-block-theme-within-wordpress/\">You Can Now Create Your Own Block Theme Within WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karks88\">Eric Karkovack</a></strong> walks you through the features of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\">WordPress Create a Block Theme plugin</a>, developed by the WordPress themes team. &#8220;The ability to create a block theme from within WordPress and then use it anywhere could be a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/how-wordpress-full-site-editing-could-impact-the-design-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">game-changer</a>&nbsp;for your workflow. It potentially cuts out a lot of time spent dealing with code and makes for a complete visual design experience.&#8221; Karkovack wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Gardner</strong>&#8216;s new block theme <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/bright-mode/\"><strong>Bright Mode</strong></a> is now available in the Theme Directory. It is &#8220;for those who love modern design and vibrant colors.&#8221; reads the theme description.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> posted a review on WPTavern: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bright-mode-a-new-block-theme-with-vibrant-colors-patterns-and-custom-block-styles\"><strong>Bright Mode: A New Block Theme with Vibrant Colors, Patterns, and Custom Block Styles</strong></a>. &#8220;If you look closely, you can see subtle hints of Gardner’s trademark style. It’s forthright and minimalist with meticulous attention to typography and spacing. The colors are bright but harmonious and balanced, so it doesn’t preclude Bright Mode from use in professional contexts.&#8221; Gooding wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-plugins-and-other\">Plugins and other NoCode tools for site owners and builders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Diego</strong> also gave a talk at West Orlando WordPress Meetup: Here is the recording. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQEeOb0qcEo\"><strong>Introduction to WordPress Full Site Editing</strong></a>. &#8220;In this presentation, Nick provided a thorough overview of FSE and discussed how you can leverage these changes to build better websites. FSE is the future of modern theming in WordPress Core, and we could not be more excited!&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The team of <strong>GenerateBlocks </strong>changed the name of ‘Template Library’ to <a href=\"https://generateblocks.com/library/\"><strong>‘Patterns Library&#8217;</strong></a> and provide 218 patterns (69 free and 149 paid) to their users </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The team of <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stackable-ultimate-gutenberg-blocks/\">Stackable</a></strong> added a <a href=\"https://wpstackable.com/blog/introducing-map-block/\">new Map Block</a> for displaying the map with the location marker. It comes with customization options for height and size and zoom level as well as choice to display additional buttons for Street View, full-size view or to offer different map types. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Free_LanceTools\"><strong>Ivica Delic</strong></a> just released the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/blocks-detector-finder/\"><strong>Blocks Detector Finder</strong></a> plugin, and it joins the league of other block finder tools. It analyses your website to find all the Gutenberg Blocks that are in use. It also detects the blocks that don&#8217;t work any more because plugins were removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/find-my-blocks/\"><strong>Find my Blocks</strong></a> by <strong>Eddy Sims</strong> offers similar insights in the usage of blocks around your site. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-building-themes-for-fse-and-word-press\">WordCamp Europe Talks on WordPress TV (Part 3) </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the last part of the 3-part series of listing WordPress Europe talks that were uploaded to WordPressTV.

The event was first founded in 2020 and will continue this year led by Joe Dolson and Amber Hinds. It was previously run by the WordPress core Accessibility Team through the WordPress Foundation but organizers are running it independently this year for ease of planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sessions will be focused on promoting and learning website accessibility best practices for WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We aim to enhance the collective knowledge of accessibility for all WordPressers<strong> </strong>and provide advice and tools that will allow more and more accessible WordPress websites to be created (or remediated),&#8221; organizer Isla Waite said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call for speakers is open and it offers a great opportunity for sharing your accessibility knowledge with a global community of WordPress enthusiasts. Organizers are aiming for a single track of 26-28 presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talks will be 40 minutes with 10-minute Q&amp;A at the end. A few hours will be dedicated to Lightning Talks, which are under 15 minutes long. Organizers are also open to people submitting panels with multiple speakers for a 50-minute session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event plans to compensate speakers with &#8220;a modest honorarium,&#8221; with the final amount dependent on fundraising. Speaker applications will remain open until August 8th, 2022, and applicants will be notified by September 15, 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers have also opened the <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/call-for-sponsors/\">call for sponsors</a> so they have the opportunity to reach as many people as possible and pay speakers for their time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This year, in addition to providing live captioning, we’re hoping to also have American Sign Language Interpretation during presentations, and budget for post-event transcription to ensure all videos on the WP Accessibility Day YouTube channel have accurate captions,&#8221; organizer Amber Hinds said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsor packages range from $500 to $3,000 so organizations of all sizes can be a part of supporting the event. Individuals can also <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/participate/volunteer/\">volunteer</a> or <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/consider-donating-to-support-wp-accessibility-day/\">donate</a> to help the event reach its financial goals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 17:42:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 13.7 Expands Custom Template Capabilities, Adds Estimated Reading Time to Info Panel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136412\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-7-expands-custom-template-capabilities-adds-estimated-reading-time-to-info-panel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4195:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-7-20-july/\">Gutenberg 13.7</a> was released this week with major updates to full-site editing (FSE) capabilities that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41875\">expand custom template creation</a>. Users can now create templates for custom taxonomies, specific terms, and single categories and tags. The update also includes the ability to create templates for specific pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on &#8220;Add New&#8221; template and selecting Category will launch a new modal where users can select a specific category: </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/21/core-editor-improvement-deeper-customization-with-more-template-options/\">separate writeup</a> about the expanded custom template capabilities, Automattic-sponsored contributor Justin Tadlock  gave a walkthrough of the template creation process and summarized the continued work on this arm of FSE features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are tons of use cases for these types of templates, only limited by what their creators want to build,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;For example, a user might want to show a grid of posts for a specific &#8216;photography&#8217; category but not change the default list style for others. A restaurant owner might remove the site’s default sidebar on the &#8216;menu&#8217; page to let photos of the dishes take center stage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these additions put more control of the CMS into users&#8217; hands than they have ever had in the earlier days of WordPress. Creating a custom template for a taxonomy or for a specific page would have been a task for which most users would have needed to hire a developer. Now anyone can create custom templates with just a few clicks inside the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Category customization is also the subject of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/07/11/fse-program-testing-call-15-category-customization/\">latest round of the FSE Program&#8217;s testing</a>, closing on August 1. The test focuses on guiding users through exploration of the general Category template and the new template picker design introduced in Gutenberg 13.6. Each testing call comes with a structured way to explore beta features along with specific questions to answer during the process.  It&#8217;s essentially a guided way to contribute to WordPress that allows people of all abilities to shape the user experience with their feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 13.7 also introduces a new &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41611\">Time to read</a>&#8221; count that users will find in the information panel at the top of the editor. It estimates the time to read for pages, posts, and custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg&#8217;s block locking feature already offers quite a bit of granular control, but this release <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41876\">expands these capabilities</a> to allow for locking all the blocks inside a container (Group, Cover, and Column blocks) with one click. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />source: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-7-20-july/\">Gutenberg 13.7 release post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable improvements in 13.7 include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Updates modal design for Preferences screen and other screens to reduce noise, add background blur, and make design more consistent &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40781\">PR #40781</a></li><li>Adds &#8220;Use featured image&#8221; to Upload and Media Library options in the placeholder for a new Cover block &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41722\">PR #41722</a></li><li>Adds text decoration support to post title block &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42328\">PR #42328</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes 167 PRs thanks to contributions from 58 people.

The company announced today that it is rolling back its <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">pricing</a> structure to the previous model, which offered five plans, including the free tier. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />WordPress.com&#8217;s updated pricing table &#8211; July 21, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, WordPress.com pared back its pricing table from five to just two plans (Free and a $15/month Pro plan) as <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-major-unannounced-pricing-changes-slashes-free-storage-limits\">a major unannounced change</a>, slashing free storage limits and imposing a traffic ceiling. After nearly two months of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-increases-traffic-and-storage-limits-on-new-plans-after-overwhelmingly-negative-feedback-on-initial-rollout\">overwhelmingly negative feedback</a>, the company added a new $5/month Starter plan to bridge the gap between Free and Pro, but even this entry level plan didn&#8217;t remove ads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes were not clicking with users and many of them announced plans to move away from WordPress.com to new platforms. The company claims it was responding to feedback in reverting to the previous pricing model, but after 15 weeks of running the experiment, they likely had enough data to force the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As we began to roll out our new pricing plans a couple of months back, we took note of the feedback you shared,&#8221; Automattic VP of Content Michael Pick said in the new pricing <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/07/21/changes-to-our-pricing-plans/\">announcement</a>. &#8220;What we heard is that some of you missed the more granular flexibility of our previous plans.

A grid displaying the patterns is now shown underneath a theme&#8217;s description and tags. These are automatically fetched from any theme that registers patterns and works for both block and classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Patterns included in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/zeever/\">Zeever</a> theme\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on a pattern will launch it within the theme preview. Visitors can see what it looks like within the context of the theme but cannot manipulate it or customize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Meta Team contributor Steve Dufresne published a short <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/07/21/pattern-previews-for-themes-in-the-directory-beta/\">announcement</a> of the pattern previews moving into beta, with a request for feedback from theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;From a technical standpoint, the pattern preview screenshots are generated by adding patterns into whichever template handles &#8216;page&#8217; rendering,&#8221; Dufresne said. &#8220;If you think the pattern preview isn’t rendering properly, try adding the pattern to a page in your theme (as a user would). If the screenshot differs significantly from what you see, please open a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">meta ticket</a>&nbsp;so we can take a look.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elma Studio co-founder Ellen Bauer noted that the preview does not render third-party blocks and opened a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6420\">ticket</a> to track this issue. Patterns that require WooCommerce or another plugin will not display correctly. Bauer said the patterns for their <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/aino/\">Aino theme</a> do look as intended, because they use the <a href=\"https://ainoblocks.io/\">AinoBlocks</a> plugin.  Unless this can be resolved, relying on a plugin to provide a theme&#8217;s patterns may be a drawback for theme authors whose primary distribution channel is WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another quirk at the moment is that patterns designed to be full-width or wide width may not be displaying as intended due to being restricted to the narrower default content size. This issue is in progress and should be resolved soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pattern previews help users get a better picture of what patterns a theme offers and how they might look inside the theme. Feedback has been positive so far, as it gives theme authors another way to showcase the possibilities their themes enable. Themes without patterns are not necessarily disadvantaged by this new preview section, as the Pattern Directory has grown considerably since its launch to host more than 800 block patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This early beta for pattern previews is the result of work on a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5995\">ticket</a> opened seven months ago requesting a demo for patterns when browsing themes in the directory. The Meta Team requests feedback and bug reports to be filed as a new ticket on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">Meta trac</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:17:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"Post Status: Strattic, WordCamps, and Growing through Relationships — Post Status Draft 120\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=102273\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://poststatus.com/strattic-wordcamps-and-growing-through-relationships/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:174:\"In this episode of Post Status Draft, Miriam talks with Post Status Editor Dan Knauss about her WordPress journey as a WordCamp organizer, agency owner, and web host founder.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 18:37:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"Post Status: The Decline of Speed Booster Pack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=102241\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://poststatus.com/the-decline-of-speed-booster-pack/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:195:\"WordPress success stories are great, but this time, you’re going to read about a failure.

The theme features a vibrant color palette with tasteful gradients, 14 beautifully designed block patterns, and so many fun variations tucked into custom block styles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to nail down a niche for many block themes, as patterns and templates make them flexible enough to serve just about any use case. Bright Mode falls into this category. It could easily be used as a business or personal website, blog, or portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look closely, you can see subtle hints of Gardner&#8217;s trademark style. It&#8217;s forthright and minimalist with meticulous attention to typography and spacing. The colors are bright but harmonious and balanced, so it doesn&#8217;t preclude Bright Mode from use in professional contexts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner has a unique perspective as one of the OG theme authors from the early days of WordPress theming when everything was just getting started. He helped kick off the commercial theme ecosystem with his Revolution theme and continues to bring that same trailblazing spirit to the new world of block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Last summer, I read an article written by Justin Tadlock about block patterns and the pattern directory (which was in beta at the time,)&#8221; Gardner said. &#8220;He linked to it, and I spent a few minutes clicking around. Finally, I saw a pattern I thought was cool and clicked the &#8216;copy pattern&#8217; button. I wanted to see how this all worked, so I opened up a post on my blog and pasted the code. Voila, there it was. At that moment, I knew—the potential of modern WordPress flashed before me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner&#8217;s new theme makes use of patterns to define every section you see in the <a href=\"https://bg.design/bright-mode/\">demo</a>. Bright Mode offers a colorful array of patterns that users can insert into their sites, including a cover image with heading, text, and buttons, multiple testimonials, different query layouts, and multiple footer and header designs. <a href=\"https://bg.design/bright-mode/\">View the demo</a> to see them all in action with sample content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner is currently building more patterns to add to Bright Mode&#8217;s collection. He said the ones likely to come next are hero sections, featured boxes, call-to-actions, a link page, and portfolio patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I had spent several months iterating on the design for Bright Mode, so I felt the need to accomplish two things: Ship it and leave the door open to adding more,&#8221; Gardner said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first install Bright Mode and click on Customize, it doesn&#8217;t look like the demo. Users would have to insert patterns to make it look closer to the screenshots. I asked Gardner about having patterns inserted in the home page by default to match the demo and he said it&#8217;s a possibility for a future update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As for inserting patterns by default, the only instance that might be useful is the Bright Mode home page, which is merely a welcome pattern, and then the grid loop below,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of course, as I add more patterns, this could be part of an update.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the unique features in this theme is the Headings block has a set of fun block styles that create a variety of color gradients for the text.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Accessibility and color contrast were paramount with the design of this theme, so much that I even created the <a href=\"https://bg.design/bright-mode/colors/\">Colors page</a>,&#8221; Gardner said. He aims to inspire more theme authors to make colors a consideration, given that many newly released FSE themes do not have any sort of intentional approach to colors. Gardner has identified a set of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors that are used in different block styles throughout the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The primary, secondary, and tertiary colors pass both WCAG 2.0 level AA and WCAG Level AAA&nbsp;contrast tests for the following: Normal Text, Large Text, Graphical Objects and User Interface Components,&#8221; Gardner said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewing the <a href=\"https://bg.design/bright-mode/styles/\">Style Guide</a>, you can see the colors applied to buttons, quotes, and social icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Bright Mode offers multiple different style options within the Quotes block. They can be plain or have a colored background or a gradient background. Quotes with no background can also have a color gradient underline applied. The nice thing about this is that this can be changed on a per-quote basis and does not have to be the same for each blockquote. Users can have a lot of fun customizing their quotes with different designs.  A few of them are pictured below. When used sparingly throughout the site they are quite striking. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<p>One of the aspects of Bright Mode that Gardner said he loves most about the theme is the way the Cover Block is used on <a href=\"https://bg.design/bright-mode/showcase/\">single pages</a>. It pulls the featured image into the Cover block and also offers custom block styles for shadows and full-height options. (The fallback is just a black header with the title). &#8220;I feel as though this really presents what&#8217;s possible with modern WordPress.,&#8221; Gardner said.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the theme, I was surprised by how many hidden gems there are to uncover in the block styles, and how much creative control users have over every aspect. The only thing I would change is ensuring the home page looks similar to the demo so users feel that they have a solid starting place without having to hunt down the patterns to reproduce the demo. Gardner has a talent for creating aesthetically pleasing patterns and in this case the more diverse set he is planning (portfolio, call-to-action, etc) would enable Bright  Mode to be used in more contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although many traditional theme authors still have some <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-contributors-get-pushback-on-proposal-to-improve-block-themes-visibility-in-the-directory\">resistance to block themes gaining more visibility</a> in the Themes Directory, Gardner is privileged to have a day job as a Developer Advocate at WP Engine where he is paid to engage with the community and help users transition to the block editor and full-site editing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Essentially, keeping pace with Gutenberg development and what’s new with WordPress is what I get paid to do,&#8221; Gardner said. &#8220;So naturally, this makes it easy to experiment with themes (like we do with <a href=\"https://frostwp.com/\">Frost</a>) and give back with resources such as our newly launched site for <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/\">Builders</a>. On top of that, I spend my free time at night and on weekends digging deep to see how far I can take things creatively.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bright Mode is the result of his personal explorations into what is possible with block theming. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/bright-mode/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> or via the Themes install screen inside the admin. More patterns, templates, and variations will be on the way in future updates to the theme. Bright Mode is among the first <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">100 block themes</a> in the directory, a milestone WordPress.org passed today.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 18:56:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:129:\"WordPress Foundation: 2022 Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship Recipients: Margherita Pelonara, Simona Simionato, and Pooja Derashri\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=278971\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:147:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/news/2022/2022-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-recipients-margherita-pelonara-simona-simionato-and-pooja-derashri/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1409:\"<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/2022-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-recipients/\">This year’s Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship recipients</a> are <strong>Margherita Pelonara, Simona Simionato, </strong>and<strong> Pooja Derashri</strong>, enthusiastic WordPress developers, Meetup and WordCamp organizers, and contributors to the open source project and WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These contributors share the passion of empowering people with WordPress. Whether helping women freelancers succeed in business (Margherita), contributing to the Diversity Speaker Training project (Simona), or being the Team Rep for the Training Team (Pooja), these women succeed in their community goals, and it’s an honor to award the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Foundation created this memorial scholarship in 2015, to honor the memory of longtime WordPress contributor Kim Parsell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scholarship provides financial support to a woman who contributes to the WordPress open source project, who would not otherwise be able to attend WordCamp US. <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/projects/kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship/\">More information on the scholarship, including past recipients, is available here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thank you to WordCamp US organizer, <a href=\"https://meetmichelle.online/\">Michelle Frechette</a>, for this post.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 16:38:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Cate DeRosia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: #35 – Akshat Choudhary on the State of WordPress Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=136255\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/35-akshat-choudhary-on-the-state-of-wordpress-security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34757:\"<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/akshatc\">Akshat Choudhary</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akshat is the Founder and CEO of BlogVault, MalCare, WP Remote and Airlift.

Thank you for having me here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are so welcome. We&#8217;re sitting in the Super Bock Arena, in a cavernous space underneath the arena. And we&#8217;re gonna talk today a little bit about Akshat, his products, why he&#8217;s turned up to WordCamp EU. First of all though Akshat just give us a little bit of a background. Who are you? Which company, companies I should say, do you represent?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:11] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Hi, I&#8217;m Akshat, I&#8217;m the founder of BlogVault, actually that&#8217;s the main company. And then we have multiple products. Some of you might have heard of BlogVault is our original product. And then we since then built Malcare. We are also associated with WP Remote, which is for agency, and we have a brand new product coming out called Airlift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, okay. Tell us what Airlift is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> So, you know, speed is such an important aspect of a website and making a website fast is, it&#8217;s a time consuming and often difficult task. So, we are using technology to make a website really fast with the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That sounds amazing. So there&#8217;s four products that you&#8217;ve got. Presumably you&#8217;ve come to WordCamp Europe to find customers, mix, network and all of those kind of things. So I&#8217;m gonna ask you a series of questions about that. Really, it boils down to this. What is the purpose? Why have you come all the way to WordCamp Europe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned that you&#8217;ve come for customers and acquire customers. And I remember the very first WordCamp I attended so many years ago, and I was in this mode of trying to acquire customers and it was miserable, like the worst possible experience. then I had to step back because WordPress and WordCamps are not, are not suitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community, the event is not, it&#8217;s not your traditional trade conference. When you attend it to just be a part of the community and try and meet people, and over time you can connect the dots, looking back that it has worked out well. So today I&#8217;m here actually, to reconnect with all the friends that I have, after three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is very much a social experience for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:43] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah. And that&#8217;s the most important aspect of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What is the main thing that you find yourself doing? So do you attend the talks and sit and chat with colleagues, or do you tend to find yourself on the hallway track, just chatting to random strangers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:57] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yeah. Hallway track, I wouldn&#8217;t even say chatting to random strangers because now so many of the folks are just such good friends. Yeah, we go back so many years, so. It&#8217;s mostly about just meeting them again and, hopefully finally in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you bring many people from your team or teams I should say? Or is it just you? Is that a difficult decision? Who gets on the plane and who doesn&#8217;t?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:19] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> We try and have a couple of people join me. In fact, a few times I have also not gone and people from the team have come, so we do it on a, on a round robin basis. So we try and get the entire team to participate in the community and meet the different folks here. Because just again, sitting in India, it&#8217;s very difficult to understand what the community is about. Coming here and interacting and volunteering. Those experiences really give you a sense of what WordPress is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just before we pushed the record button, I mentioned some of the things that we may be talking about, and one of them was the community where you are based. So, first of all, where are you based?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:56] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> So I&#8217;m based in Bangalore in India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And tell us about the community that may or may not exist there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> So we do have a small community, but it&#8217;s not a very, very active community. And it also makes you realize that while Bangalore is the tech hub of India, you know, it&#8217;s called the Silicon Valley of India. And there are so many people doing tech and I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of people doing WordPress. But we&#8217;ve never really been able to kickstart a healthy community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have any insight into why that is? Is it just that it just never took off or nobody took the responsibility to organize it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:28] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> It makes you appreciate the work that the folks who are building these communities are doing, because it&#8217;s a commitment. I think people spend a part of their lives to make this thing happen at each of these local chapters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess, somebody needs to come up with that passion to make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it is a different experience here than it would be over there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yeah. Significantly different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of the event itself, what do you make of this venue? I mean, when I showed up and saw it, I mean I&#8217;d seen pictures, and I thought that looks pretty large.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That looks pretty impressive. And then when I actually got here, this is beyond anything I imagined. It&#8217;s truly enormous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:06] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yeah, it is an extremely large, really large venue. And I actually still didn&#8217;t know what to expect until I entered, and the organization is, the way they have organized it with one section going to sponsors another with the tracks, with the actual talks. It&#8217;s a very, very large venue and with a lot of space all around to meet people and to talk with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I was looking at a WordCamp and I can&#8217;t actually summon up which one it was, but it was a State of the Word address from. I&#8217;m gonna say it was about 10 years ago. I was watching the video recently and it looked like a cottage industry. It looked as if they were basically in a theater and the signage was all very thrown together. And you compare that to what there is out there, a few yards away from us, it&#8217;s Incredible how WordPress has grown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the moment, as of recording this we&#8217;re in the low forties. So 42, 43% of all websites. You&#8217;ve obviously strapped yourself to the bandwagon of WordPress, which historically has been an amazing decision. I mean, I&#8217;m guessing that you&#8217;re just jubilant about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yes, no, I&#8217;d consider myself extremely lucky. I wouldn&#8217;t say it was a, it was a well thought out decision as to, yes, I&#8217;m going to get onto this rocket ship. We are extremely fortunate to be a part of the success story that WordPress is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very recently, and I don&#8217;t know what your thoughts are on this, because it feels a bit like a Chicken Little story. Recently some statistics came out to show that for the first time ever, the market share for WordPress had actually taken a teeny tiny, nevertheless, a teeny tiny decline had occurred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was lots of people writing commentary about this and saying, well, that&#8217;s interesting. Maybe the growth of a WordPress is over. What&#8217;s your thoughts on all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:45] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yeah, I think numbers, you know, they can be very confusing and especially the number around market share. It&#8217;s a lot of marketing more than anything else. So, when it&#8217;s going up, it sounds really nice and you know, 45%, but the way you calculate it. I think if you are today creating a business website, or if you&#8217;re creating a personal website, WordPress is the go to place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do have a lot of other technologies coming up. So you will see and you&#8217;ll see different things take off. Honestly, I tend to ignore it. I don&#8217;t worry too much about it. And also, I don&#8217;t worry too much about what&#8217;s going to happen with WordPress. So I think every technology has its own cycle it has to follow. And my favorite examples are like Nokia and Blackberry. Those were iconic, massive companies and they disappeared in five years. So when the time comes, it&#8217;ll come, and you can&#8217;t do really do much about it, but until then, yeah, until then let&#8217;s do the most of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think you&#8217;ve probably hit the nail on the head. Nothing is imutable. Everything in its time will cease to be as popular as it once was. Like you said, certain companies like Nokia, I don&#8217;t even know if you can buy a Nokia phone anymore, but certainly in the day they were the only things that you could buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your businesses, the ones that you mentioned earlier, they fit into the sort of client side, client management piece, a little bit. So you&#8217;ve got the ability with BlogVault to be able to migrate your sites. And you&#8217;ve also got the ability to back them up and do security, and all of that Is that the bit where you&#8217;ve pitched your business? Are you sort of aiming them at agencies who are then selling that services, perhaps packaged up in a care plan or something like that? Is that where you are pitching?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yes. So we actually have two segments of customers. And in fact, we are sponsoring this WordCamp under WP Remote brand, and that&#8217;s the brand which is targeted towards agencies. Where we take all our products, we are selling that product to agencies. And agencies then who have, which again, is something we have seen over the past few years, the concept of maintenance plans. So agencies manage WordPress sites for the clients, and then they, they use our products to manage large number of sites. And we make it really easy with the backup security, updates and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our job really is to make that job easier. So if you&#8217;re running a business critical website, we make it easy to run that website and make the most out of it. And, we sell to two customer segments. You have agencies who are buying large number of sites, and then you have individual site owners, like small businesses or en enthusiast, so marketing teams. And they are buying it for small number of websites. So yeah, there are two customer segments essentially that we target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned security there. Since the last time I met you, which is probably three or four years ago, I think it was probably in WordCamp London or like that. Yeah. It seems like an age ago now. The amount of security news has been truly stratospheric. Every single week there seems to be something. Now whether or not that&#8217;s hype, or it&#8217;s written about because people are interested in, I don&#8217;t really know. I don&#8217;t really have any insight into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously the market share of WordPress paints, a bigger target, you know, 42, 43% of the web people are gonna invest time into figuring out what&#8217;s vulnerable there. Have you noticed that? Is that a trend? Do we need to be more concerned this year than we were last year about the security of WordPress? And do we need to have things to mitigate? Obviously I&#8217;m sure you would say yes, because you&#8217;ve got all the solutions provided for that, but what&#8217;s your thoughts of the state of security in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yes. So, I think the security is obviously a moving thing and there&#8217;s never, there&#8217;s no such thing as absolute security. Right. So it will never be in a state where we&#8217;ll be like, okay, fine. Everything is secure. Everything is good. You&#8217;ll always need to be wary of it. And especially when you look at something like WordPress, which has such a thriving ecosystem around it. So then security is not limited to one small thing, but it&#8217;s spread all over the ecosystem, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So every aspect of it needs to be secure, and which becomes so much more difficult to do. As you have more plugin, more themes, and as this ecosystem also expands it adds a lot more complexity to the whole WordPress security concept. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very, very important to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if you go back to Windows, days when Windows was considered extremely insecure and while Windows also had its own challenges, a lot of the security challenges came from drivers and all the stuff that you were built using on top of Windows. That&#8217;s a similar concept or we can draw similar analogy to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while WordPress, the core itself gets more and more secure over time, and we have seen that evolve, and I think there&#8217;s so much noise around, you know, like people get offended like, oh yeah, WordPress is insecure. No, no WordPress is actually secure, but then the plugins are insecure. But you open a website, you go into the WP admin and you see they have 20 plugins and there&#8217;s somebody willing to add a 21st plugin because you need to get something done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at the end of it, when you&#8217;re using WordPress with all these plugins and yeah, I would venture to guess that what, some of the reasons why some of the biggest websites use WordPress is also because of the plugins. Because it gives you that flexibility. So there&#8217;s always going to be more plugins added to websites, more complexity added there. And that means security is always going to be a challenge. You can&#8217;t take it for granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What with 50,000 plus plugins in the repository, plus all of the commercial ones, which are countless, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a number equal to that, possibly bigger. How do you even begin to keep on top of that? Is this just a case of your reading other blog posts about security and your getting information from databases? How do you on the BlogVault side of things and the Malcare side of things, how do you know what needs to be patched and when it needs to be patched?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> So we do keep a close eye on what&#8217;s happening in the security space. Our approach to security is not to be on top of everything that&#8217;s happening in the security. We look at it from a first principle perspective. As to how do sites really get hacked? What happens when they get hacked? What causes them to be hacked? What do vulnerabilities look like? So not specific vulnerability, because there are so many plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;ll see this so often, you know, you&#8217;ll see a vulnerability getting declared. Suppose a vulnerability gets declared today. You&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s been exploited for years before that or months before that. So declaring vulnerability versus where with announcement is made was the actual exploit. So that, that we believe is not the right way of securing. So we don&#8217;t really try and be on top of every single news. Obviously we do it out of interest, but not as a mechanism to secure websites. So we take a more fundamental approach as to why do websites get hacked? What happens when they get hacked and then try and patch it or try and secure it from that principle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, let&#8217;s drill down into that a little bit more then. So what does that mean? Because, it may be confusing to people listening. So if you&#8217;re not finding the vulnerabilities and setting up. I presume there&#8217;s like a firewall piece in all of this. So tell us about that, how it works, how does it stop traffic getting into the website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:21] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> This is actually a very, very fascinating topic and this is something which is close to our heart. And, I would venture to say, I mean, like we know that things can be improved significantly, and we are far from reaching the final vision. We can always, we can see month by month we are moving towards this final vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress security, again, there&#8217;s so much noise out there, you know, and I may dare to say there&#8217;s a lot of snake oil being sold also. And that just makes it so much more difficult because you will find some of the most credible people out there, unfortunately spreading misinformation, not willfully. Just because the whole space is so noisy, and so confusing..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, we believe firewall is one of the best ways of protecting a site. Let&#8217;s look at like different ways sites get hacked and there are numerous. I&#8217;ll just take a few examples to show you what happens. For example, one type of exploit, and this is actually happens much more often than you would think, is it lets you change the URL within the database of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s actually a very simple operation. One way you can block it is you look at any request that caused that specific operation to get updated and just block it out. If it is not done with appropriate privileges. And that&#8217;s one example of how you can mitigate an attack type. So that just shows you that that&#8217;s one way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are others. Like we, we know the famous OS SQL injection attacks, which try and exploit vulnerabilities while accessing the database. There&#8217;s a whole amount of literature out there as to how to block SQL injection attacks and we can tap into those rules to block out SQL injection attacks. So as soon as you do that, you have saved yourself from a whole bunch of vulnerabilities that affect a lot of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just before we keep going, I&#8217;m curious because a lot of people who listen to this may have only a glimer of an understanding of how WordPress works. So, how does a firewall in fact work? How do you get in front of things before it hits the website and sniff it and say, okay, this is clearly not supposed to happen. Let&#8217;s just drop this. Let&#8217;s make this not happen. How does that even work? What&#8217;s the process that you are interrupting that would normally happen if there isn&#8217;t a firewall there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:26] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> All right. So firewall again, there are multiple types of firewalls and multiple levels at which firewalls get deployed. You have cloud based firewall, something like Cloudflare or a Sucuri, which is a very popular WordPress plugin, WordPress security. solution. They have, basically they have a cloud based solution where when someone visits your website, it reaches their servers first. And then it passes through their firewall servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ours is more of a plugin based solution. So, we attach yourself inside your website through a plugin. And what we do is we, and there are multiple ways of doing it, but, depending on the type of hosting you in, we&#8217;ll be the very first set of, scripts or code to load even before WordPress loads. What we are doing is common with, Wordfence does also a similar takes, a similar approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right, so every request is then parsed. Identified. We classify the request as to look at all the parameters that happens in the request. We classify, what looks like a good request versus a bad request based on rules. And we have a whole number of rules, which evaluate, and we see, okay, that looks funny. That should not happen. That looks like a SQL injection attack. That looks like a XSS attack. And we identify using patterns. And then we block them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some more complex ones. Like the one I spoke about where a URL gets updated. There we actually sit deep inside WordPress and we let WordPress load. But in case an operation to modify WordPress takes place, which it should not happen normally, then this piece of code will kick in. And that&#8217;s the advantage of having a plug-in based solution because, you now understand how WordPress functions and then tap into that knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other solutions, maybe like a Cloudflare where they don&#8217;t really understand WordPress and they have taken a more of a generic, good, best practices of blocking attacks. And they&#8217;re also effective. But I think when you understand WordPress, when you understand this application so well, you can do things in a manner which, yeah which can improve the security of a WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that you&#8217;re getting in the way sometimes, you&#8217;re the first thing that&#8217;s happening and so on. People, again, listening may thinking, oh, okay, that sounds like an extra step. And if there&#8217;s an extra step, is that gonna slow things down? Because there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s got to be inspected before it&#8217;s passed through the firewall and allowed to happen. Typically, are you pretty confident about if you put these things in place, you&#8217;re not really gonna see a significant drop in the amount of time it takes to get the first bite or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:57] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Right, we take a great deal of care to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t really slow it down. But again, you need to go deeper into how WordPress functions and you realize that there are so many layers to what causes a WordPress site, what impacts the performance of a WordPress site. And you will see that the PHP pieces and especially the kind of operations we deal with is multiple order of magnitudes faster than the slowest operation, which might be a database query. And while a WordPress request is served. There are numerous database queries being made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in comparison to that, this might be, so if that takes a thousand milliseconds, let&#8217;s assume, this operation might take one millisecond, two milliseconds. So it just dwarves in front of everything else that&#8217;s happening. Obviously we need to always make sure that this thing does not exceed one or two milliseconds or a few milliseconds, but the difference is so large that you will never notice the impact of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, there&#8217;s so much confusion around it. That having a working model around this is not straightforward, and it&#8217;s very easy to be like, oh, this will slow down my website, but how will it slow down what&#8217;s happening? And that complexity is, I think the communication around that has not been great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Another concern that people may have is because you said, your setup, it has to make judgments about whether this should be passed through or not. This is malicious, or this is not malicious. How easy is it for that system to fail and throw false positives and to erroneously apply the ban hammer to things which should be allowed to pass through. Typically, I&#8217;m guessing that, you get better at that over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:29] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> It does happen, but it&#8217;s fairly rare. So again, pattern matching is not an exact science, right? It&#8217;s like finding, you know, on a street finding a, a rogue character or a thief by looking at typical characteristics. Yeah, that does happen, but it&#8217;s fairly rare and we try and take a lot of steps to always improve our rules around it. And it&#8217;s a work in progress. I wouldn&#8217;t say it never happens. I almost think that nobody should promise it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So four products in the suite. You&#8217;ve got WP Remote, Malcare, BlogVault, and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:00] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Airlift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Airlift the brand new one that you mentioned at the beginning. All kind of representing security and client management and what have you. Tell us about what you&#8217;ve got planned? If we were to come back, WordCamp Europe, what may we see? What exciting new things have you got up your sleeve?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> First we are heads down focused on these four things and they&#8217;re each actually very big products just by themselves. Our overall aim is to keep doubling down on these and spend a lot of energy making them perfect. When I started BlogVault a few years ago, I thought it was like a six week project. And even today I&#8217;m finding ways of improving it. So at least we want to make sure that we are focused on these four things and making it work seamlessly and just keep improving it, because it&#8217;s a very time consuming process to build a great product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So the roadmap is more about getting it more refined rather than adding feature upon feature upon feature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:52] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yes, it&#8217;s always about, and that&#8217;s my learning over time, that you need to focus on just improving the functionality, existing functionality instead of adding new things. And it&#8217;s so easy to, you know, as builders, it&#8217;s so easy to get distracted and be like, oh, well there&#8217;s this nice little shiny thing a customer&#8217;s asking for it. Let&#8217;s just build it out. Which is almost how Airlift got started, because we also had so much to do on Malcare and WP Remote, BlogVault. But we are like, okay, that looks like an interesting problem, which we can solve. But hopefully we are going to be focused only on these four things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it does feel as if there is quite a lot of that. What I mean by that is that features get added year on year. That seems to be the email that comes through is that we&#8217;ve got this great new feature. That&#8217;s why you need to check us out. It&#8217;s quite an interesting and different approach for you to reject that and say, actually the product that we&#8217;ve got is pretty solid. We just wanna make it more solid and there probably won&#8217;t be a great deal of new features going in, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:43] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Yes, and you know, customers, the best customers, really value quality over the number of features. So the, the best website they want, like, okay, fine. I need it to be as reliable as it gets. And that&#8217;s actually been the biggest selling point for us. And, it&#8217;s easy for me to talk about it like this. The thing is the monkey in the head is always like, let&#8217;s chase this new feature. But the learning is that you need to keep improving it. And the best customers, the people who pay us the most people who, who we want to put on the website, you know, on our marketing site, like the logos, they want the most reliable, the most efficient, the best product out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just before we wrap it up, a few minutes ago, you said something about the fact that you thought that, maybe it was BlogVault, I don&#8217;t know which one you were working on, was gonna be a six week project. So let&#8217;s rewind. Akshat, your life to that moment where you thought you were gonna build it and to where you are now and how life has changed. It must be quite an exciting thing to look back on. You&#8217;ve had a really remarkable journey from building a product that you had no particular expectation would take off. And then it really, really did take off and, and here we are now sat in a room in WordCamp Europe in Portugal, 2022. It&#8217;s been a very good journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:53] <strong>Akshat Choudary:</strong> Absolutely. Like I just look it, I consider again, and I have mentioned this so many times to different people, is I consider myself extremely, extremely fortunate. Especially like we spoke earlier, the WordPress bandwagon, the, and if I may call it that, but the success story of WordPress. I was so lucky to latch onto it at that point of time and just grow with it. And I&#8217;ve grown as a person also through this journey.

It doesn’t wrap me in the look I’d imagined, however. It feels like quality material, sure, but not ostentatious or high-falutin’ or fancy-pants. (Well, maybe there’s the occasional fancy-pants aspect of it, which I’ll be sure to mention at the end of the story). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-success\">What is Success?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the definitions that Merriam-Webster presents for the word “success” is “<em>the attainment of wealth, favor, or eminence</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My definition of success has always been to live free of poverty. I don’t ask much of success. Just the vision of a life without the constant weight of poverty wrapped around a person’s neck is enough for me to define that life as successful. But of course, there are many ways to define success, and I suppose that makes a big difference in how people view their own lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a late bloomer to my version of success, although most people would have assumed I’d been this successful for decades. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But in every way, WordPress is at the heart of my newfound success, regardless of how or when it happened. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://donnacavalier.com/one-womans-journey-towards-wordpress/\">I’ve told parts of my story before</a>. In that telling of my tale, what you won’t find is any indication that I was poor &#8211; miserably poor &#8211; throughout most of it. For years, I’ve joked to my family that I’m great at becoming “industry famous” but terrible at earning money at it. At one time, I was one of the premier Cold Fusion developers in the world, though I doubt CF’ers would remember me all these years later. After that, I was a well-known SEO, although I went by a “forum name” at the time, so my name now isn’t recognizable except to those I’m still friends with. And while I wasn’t necessarily ever WordPress-famous, I wasn’t invisible in the community either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason I was industry famous each of those times was that I spent a lot of my time in the forums or communities where everyone hung out. In my time there, I gave back every chance I got. I’d generally learned my craft from those same types of communities, so once I had obtained valuable knowledge, I answered questions and helped people learn there. Eventually, I would end up being a moderator in most of those communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if success is defined by <em>eminence</em>, as Merriam-Webster suggests, or the level of recognition you get from your peers, or the amount of respect you earn from those you mentor, then I was very successful throughout much of my adult life. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-eminence-does-not-equal-wealth\">Eminence Does Not Equal Wealth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that version of success or what I called “industry fame,” I could never afford to use any “pro” plugins or tools that weren’t free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve never owned a copy of Photoshop in my life. (I take that back. A friend gave me a nulled version once &#8211; a really old version &#8211; but I was too paranoid and “law-abiding” to ever use it). Even though my job as a web designer pretty much required the use of Photoshop, I had to settle for <a href=\"https://gimp.org\">Gimp</a>. Priced at somewhere around $600 (if I remember right), Photoshop was about $599 too expensive for me. If a client handed me a .psd file, I’d ask industry friends who owned Photoshop to turn it into a format I could import into Gimp. Of course, that meant there were many Photoshop files I couldn’t work with at all if I needed to access some aspect of the file that Gimp didn’t support. In those cases, I had to turn the job down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO was made more difficult without money to spend. Paying even $20 for an SEO tool that would make my work easier was never an option. If it wasn’t free, it didn’t happen. Occasionally, I’d get lucky and win the use of a tool during an online giveaway. You have no idea how excited I’d get when that happened. It always felt like I’d won the lottery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did attend as many SEO conferences as I could over the years. Industry acquaintances who believed I needed to be there generously paid for some of those conferences. I am forever grateful to those people. Some I managed to scrape up enough money to attend, especially if they were reasonably close to where I lived. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-where-did-i-go-wrong\">Where Did I Go Wrong?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So why was I so poor? Why did my version of success elude me for so long? I’m not sure I know all the reasons for that, but I’d like to share some of the reasons that I do know. Some may be helpful to anyone in the same situation; others were personal and unique to me (perhaps).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the most obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Imposter Syndrome</strong>. I did graduate from college with a B.S. in English Education. Back in my day, women were expected to do “women’s type of work,” such as teaching. I really wanted to study Computer Science, but the head of the CS department told my mom that it would probably be too hard for me, so Mom convinced me not to do that. (My mom loved me very much, and I’m sure she thought she was saving me from failure or something, but she was wrong to not trust in me). I graduated and never worked as a teacher a day in my life. (At least not in a formal school situation. Most of my life has been dedicated to teaching others how to do things, however). So instead of teaching, I moved to California, worked as a data entry person for years, and slowly began to teach myself how to code. In those days, we didn’t have an internet filled with free courses to learn from. I would occasionally find an old “How to code in Fortran” book, or something similar,  in someone’s garage sale. But no matter how much I learned, I was always missing some sort of fundamental knowledge that I assumed had been taught in formal education. And I always knew I wasn’t as good as all those people who had that education. That prevented me from ever trying to apply for “real jobs” in the IT or future web-related industries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why else did I take so long to get to this level of success? A few reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Under-charging</strong>. Hand-in-hand with imposter syndrome, not charging enough money for services provided was very typical for me. </li>\n<li><strong>Only Serving Poor People</strong>. Just like under-charging, I rarely tried to acquire big, well-paying clients. Of course, my imposter syndrome drove that decision to a large extent, but my own keen understanding of how difficult it was to find success also caused me to have an overwhelming desire to help others do better than me. I jumped on the chance to help someone make their dreams come true, even if they only had $100 to start their business (or less). I would work for peanuts if it meant I could help someone else that didn’t have the means to get help elsewhere. So while imposter syndrome primarily drove those decisions, my desire to help others drove the rest of the way. I had all the knowledge needed to help them learn what they needed to know to succeed, even if I wasn’t succeeding myself.</li>\n<li><strong>Relationship mistakes</strong>. When a personal relationship would go bad, I would leave with pretty much the clothes on my back, just to get out of a bad situation without any hassle. Instead of taking the few “valuable” things I might own with me, I would let the abusive partner keep it all. That would mean starting over every time—new furniture, new TV, etc. I could never get ahead because I was always losing it all.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a few short, successful moments in all those years. Occasionally, I would land a decent client that would pay the bills for a couple of months, and each of those rare occasions would give me the incentive I needed to continue on. I also managed to create a few decent blogs and affiliate sites that I sold for BIG MONEY ($10,000 or so). That was huge and definitely worthy of the “success” label. But that money didn’t lead to more success. Those sales just allowed me to climb out of the abyss of debt I’d gotten into by then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here’s the irony of it all. I had a few clients that I helped make LOTS OF MONEY. Millions, even. And while one of those clients paid me well for about a year (and by well, I’m talking about $2,000/month), most of the time, I got paid a few hundred dollars for my time and advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were ups and downs in the money-earning game. The ups encouraged me to continue, the downs were the day-to-day reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-and-then-came-wordpress\">And Then Came WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress didn’t immediately bring success, but it made my life of poverty incrementally better with each passing year. Although WordPress initially made my own sites easier to manage and much more engaging, I quickly realized that WordPress was the key to me being able to create websites for others &#8211; and charging for it! I soon realized that I could make a better and steadier income by designing WordPress websites than I could at trying to get SEO clients. Of course, WordPress and SEO were co-partners in my career for quite a few years. I could design a site, add in some SEO services, and offer a nice bundle to clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I STILL had the problem of under-charging. That didn’t magically go away overnight, unfortunately. But instead of having maybe 3 or 4 clients a year, I began to get maybe 1 client a month. Small job or not, my income was becoming steadier, and that made a difference. I was poor still &#8211; but less desperately poor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-as-an-aside\">As an aside: </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the midst of one particular bad relationship, I decided to &#8211; finally &#8211; utilize my writing skills and write a novel. I imagined this would be the ultimate residual income, right? Write something once, and then live off the sales forever. That might work for the Anne Rices or Stephen Kings of the world, but the reality for people like me is that each book sold nets me around $2, so selling a few hundred (which is typical) means I’d still be poor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-back-to-the-wordpress-story\">Back to the WordPress story…</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress, I was able to lose my imposter syndrome. I had the same level of WordPress education as everyone else who dived into learning it. They didn’t get “formal education” in WP either. I was playing on the same field, and that gave me the confidence I needed to excel. To be fair, I didn’t need a formal education for either Cold Fusion development or SEO. And yet, for whatever reason, WordPress helped me see that I belonged in a way that those other platforms did not. I don’t know why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of my other issues took longer to shed. I still felt the need to work with mostly poor clients. I still felt scared to seek out the large clients. But gradually, very, very gradually, those issues started to fall away, like shedding bits of old skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make everything better, I LOVED working with WordPress. I LOVED letting my creativity flow when designing a site. WordPress made my work fun, so even if I wasn’t making a lot of money, I was at least enjoying what I was doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, some of that “fame” began to translate into money. I finally allowed myself to take some risks and actually apply for jobs that I would never have applied for in the past. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take nothing else from this story, I hope some of you at least take this to heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TAKE THE RISK</strong>. Apply for the job or attempt to get the bigger client. Of course, don’t apply for something you know absolutely nothing about. For a job position, don’t assume that you won’t get the job, even though you have the skills and knowledge needed. Instead, give it all you’ve got. Create a kick-ass resume that you edit and refine until it’s perfect. Write a cover letter that showcases why you’d be right for them. Go into interviews prepared. Anticipate questions you’ll likely be asked, and plan out your answers. Be prepared, and take.the.risk. The worst that happens is you’ll not get the job, but you won’t be any worse off than you are right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mention this specifically because taking the risk (twice) is what led me to finally be able to say, “I’ve made it.” I’m a success. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time, I noticed a job opening mentioned in a Facebook group for the WordPress plugin I used for every site I designed. I knew the ins and outs of this plugin better than most. The job description sounded perfect for me (documenting the plugin). My first thought: “Wow, this would be perfect for me.” My second thought: “I’ll never get the job.” My third thought: “Oh hell, Donna, just apply for it. Why the hell not?”. I applied. I got the job. My life suddenly changed. I was no longer living in poverty, but I was still very low middle class, I’d say. Everything was still paycheck to paycheck, with nothing left over to either save or spend. But stability had been achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second time, I received a LinkedIn message from someone who worked at Automattic, suggesting I apply for a job with them. I. WAS. FLOORED. What??? Automattic? THE Automattic? My first thought: “This would be a dream come true.” My second thought: “There’s no way in hell they’d hire me.” My third thought: “Oh hell, Donna, just apply for it. Why the hell not?”. I applied. I got the job. I AM NOW SUCCESSFUL. Bonus: I get to work with amazing people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey to success took way too long. I hope yours is much, much shorter. Hopefully, something in this story might give someone the push they need to shed some of their old skin, let some of the issues holding them back fall away, leaving them with a tiny bit of confidence to take a risk. To trust just a little more in their own abilities and help them realize they have something valuable to offer. To get the bigger client. To charge a little (or a lot) more. To apply for the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress doesn’t force you to go to college.</li>\n<li>WordPress doesn’t require previous experience.</li>\n<li>WordPress opens doors for everyone.</li>\n<li>WordPress is fun.</li>\n<li>WordPress can be your ticket to success.</li>\n<li>WordPress was my ticket to success.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So I promised I would share some of the fancy-pants bits of success that I’ve obtained. I’ve acquired a lovely home and a nice car. Those are definitely signs of success, but there is one thing that I would truly consider to be “fancy-pants,” and I allowed myself to indulge in it. It was tough to consider myself worthy of spending money on such an item, but I did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to say that the first thing I’d get if I ever won the lottery would be a live-in, full-time masseuse. I didn’t win the lottery, but I am successful, so I did the next best thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought myself an expensive massage chair. Yeah, the kind you see in malls? Only this one is even fancier and pantsier than most of those! Specifically, I got the Real Relax Massage Chair, Full Body Zero Gravity SL-Track Shiatsu Massage Chair Recliner with Heat Body Scan Foot Roller from Amazon. It cost me $1600 at the time, though it’s now listed at $1799. I use this daily to relax, de-stress, and work some soreness out of my muscles. </p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>I still wear jeans or leggings, and mostly conference swag t-shirts, so the way I “wear my success” doesn’t look much different than the way I wore my poverty. But there are signs that I’ve made it. My house. My car. My massage chair. That’s fancy-pants. That’s my version of success. And WordPress is the reason it all happened.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/success-looks-different-on-everyone-i-guess/\">Success Looks Different On Everyone, I Guess</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 13:00:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Donna Cavalier\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Do The Woo Community: dev_life snippet: A WooCommerce Project Delivery Process Tip\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72446\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-project-delivery-process-tip/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:394:\"<p>To optimize the WooCommerce site project process, consider two to five days frames.

The idea is rooted in comments that Twenty Twenty-Two designer Kjell Reigstad made last year when introducing the theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Themes are in a transition period today, and it seems like this may be a reasonable time to step back and to re-evaluate the annual cadence with which we build default themes.</p><p>Innovations like theme.json, block templates, and block patterns are making theme development far simpler, and are providing new ways for users to customize their sites. There’s reason to believe that the community can leverage all this to build more frequent and diverse theme and customization solutions for our users in the coming years. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of creating a new default theme this year, design contributors are proposing creating a curated set of style variations from community submissions. The styles would be applied to a pared back version of Twenty Twenty-Two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What if, instead of emphasizing the theme itself, we highlighted an opinionated set of style variations designed by members of the community?&#8221; Automattic-sponsored design contributor Channing Ritter said. &#8220;We could use Twenty Twenty-Two as the basis for a new theme that’s stripped back and minimal — a blank canvas to let a diverse range of style variations shine.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variations were <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/global-styles-variations-in-wordpress-6-0/\">introduced in WordPress 6.0</a> as a way for theme authors to offer some preset design options capable of skinning the site with different colors, typography, borders, spacing, and more, with just one click on a card representing the variation. Reigstad first floated the idea for Twenty Twenty-Two&#8217;s style variations in November 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Last week I built a handful of Twenty Twenty-Two\'s color + font variations into super-simple child themes.

The discussion has just started in the comments of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/07/19/proposal-a-new-kind-of-default-theme/\">proposal</a> and contributors are soliciting feedback on the creation of the next default theme.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 03:41:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Poe: A Bold New Portfolio Theme with 30+ Block Patterns and 10 Style Variations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136294\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/poe-a-bold-new-portfolio-theme-with-30-block-patterns-and-10-style-variations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2551:\"<p>The WordPress Themes Directory is sitting at <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">99 block themes today</a> and will soon cross a major milestone. This momentum has been driven in part by independent designers like Brian Gardner, Anders Norén, and Rich Tabor, to name a few, who have fully embraced the new era of block themes and are leading the way with a seemingly never-ending supply of inspiration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh on the heels of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-remakes-davis-theme-as-davis-blocks-with-full-site-editing-support\">remaking his Davis theme</a> to support full-site editing, Anders Norén has released another free WordPress theme with an opinionated, bold vibe, designed for portfolios and blogs. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/poe/\">Poe</a>, named for American writer and poet Edgar Allen Poe, features bright color combinations and a chunky layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Poe uses Davis Blocks as its foundation and  Norén plans to continue using it as a starting point for future themes, as the theme is lightweight and doesn&#8217;t include any patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The new Full Site Editing features in WordPress allow block themes to be really small, and really fast,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;Poe is no exception. It includes no JavaScript and less than 450 lines of CSS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poe boasts a large collection of more than 30 patterns that users can mix and match when building layouts. These include unique designs like a work process description with multiple steps, a logo grid with title and description, portfolio filtration formatted as a row of buttons, various hero cover image patterns with buttons and header, call-to-action sections, different blog layouts, various footer designs, and more. With just a few customizations, a site using Poe can look very different from the <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/poe/\">demo&#8217;s default look</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Poe also offers 10 different style variations that instantly transform the design with artfully curated color combinations. The typography and spacing are also customized to complement the different styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although the design is geared towards portfolios with several patterns for featuring past work and clients, the theme can easily be customized to be a blog, agency, or business website.  <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/poe/\">Poe</a> is available for free on WordPress.org or it can be added through the admin in the Themes install screen. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 21:33:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"Do The Woo Community: Insights and Tips from Long-Time Woo Product Builder Beka Rice\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72271\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/insights-tips-woocommerce-product-builder/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:437:\"<p>Beka has been building products for WooCommerce for several years and brings retrospect and perspective to the show about the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/insights-tips-woocommerce-product-builder/\">Insights and Tips from Long-Time Woo Product Builder Beka Rice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 09:58:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: WordPress Performance Team Is Working on a Module for SVG Uploads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136263\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-team-is-working-on-a-module-for-svg-uploads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3056:\"<p>If you have ever tried to upload an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file for a logo or favicon in WordPress, you may have been astonished to find that it doesn&#8217;t work. There is no core support so users rely on plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/svg-support/\">SVG Support</a> (900K+ installs) or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-svg/\">Safe SVG</a> (600k+ installs) to upload SVG files to the media library and use them like any other image file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main advantage of SVG files is they can scale to any dimension without losing quality. They are also compact and SEO-friendly because they are stored in XML text files that can be crawled and indexed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress contributors have been <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251\">discussing adding SVG support</a> for more than nine years. It was talked to death with various proofs of concept and no clear path forward, and the ticket eventually became a place where people periodically stop by and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251#comment:93\">comment</a> that it&#8217;s &#8220;a goddamn tragedy that WordPress doesn&#8217;t support this yet.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the format having <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=svg\">nearly universal support across the web</a>, there are security concerns associated with scripted SVGs, where files might contain a malicious script. Without an SVG sanitizer library, users would be uploading SVG files at their own risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the most <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/12/performance-team-meeting-summary-12-july-2022/\">recent Performance Team meeting</a>, contributors <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/410\">proposed</a> the idea of working on a new SVG uploads module. They are first aiming to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/357\">allow users to upload SVG files without scripts</a> and provide an SVG preview in the Media Library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although more than a million WordPress users have installed a plugin to add SVG uploads to their sites, none of these plugins are feature plugins. This is why the Performance Team has opted to create a module within the Performance Lab plugin. It allows the team to better test the feature in the wild before proposing it for WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at current implementations in plugins, the team found many of them offer more features than the scope of this module would include. The most popular plugins all currently use the <a href=\"https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer\">SVG Sanitizer</a> library, as does <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/svg_sanitizer\">a Drupal module</a> and an integration for <a href=\"https://github.com/TYPO3GmbH/svg_sanitizer\">TYPO3 CMS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance team contributors have identified WordPress 6.2 as a realistic goal for proposing the module for core. Anyone who wants to contribute can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/427\">join their efforts on GitHub</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 03:19:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"Post Status: It’s not the size that matters…\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=102213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://poststatus.com/its-not-the-size-that-matters/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:467:\"Can WordPress’s heavy reliance on volunteerism be offset or better supported by those most able to subsidize the work of others and their access to events?

Poe also comes with ten different Global Styles variations – a feature introduced in WordPress 6.0 that allow you to change between different theme styles (colors, fonts, spacing) with the click of a button in the Global Styles panel.&#8221; It is Noren&#8217;s third block theme and the 96th Block theme in the directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another new theme in that list is <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/axton/\">Axton</a> </strong>by the theme shop <em>Catch Themes</em>. <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> reviewed the theme for the WPTavern in the article: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/axton-a-free-block-based-portfolio-theme-with-full-site-editing-support\"><strong>Axton: A Free Block-based Portfolio Theme with Full-Site Editing Support</strong></a>. &#8220;The theme boasts more than 15 block patterns, 17 full-site editing (FSE) templates, and nine template parts.

The event is gaining momentum as organizers were selected earlier this year and the call for sponsors opened last month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asia&#8217;s inaugural flagship WordCamp will be hosted February 17-19, at IconSiam in Bangkok Thailand with 1,500 attendees expected. It kicks off with a contributor day followed by two conference days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers have now <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-speakers/\">opened the call for speakers</a> and are looking for &#8220;diverse topics and inspirational stories.&#8221; Prospective speakers who need some inspiration may browse suggested topics, which include everything from development to careers and marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other WordCamps, this event will include long talks (30 minutes plus Q&amp;A) and lightning talks (10 minutes and no Q&amp;A). The schedule will have each long talk in its own hour slot with a 15-minute break between sessions for networking. All sessions will be conducted in English this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia&#8217;s organizers made it clear that they do not intend to approve first-time or inexperienced speakers. A demonstration of prior speaking experience is required. Speakers will need to include at least one video link to a previous talk in their applications. For those who have never spoken at a WordPress event, the organizers recommend applicants get some practice at a local meetup or an <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">upcoming WordCamp</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers are not planning to host any workshops at this time but may open a separate call for workshops if the situation changes. The speaker application deadline is September 15, 2022, and selection announcements will begin November 15, 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 02:45:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"Post Status: Market Size and Market Shares: Thinking Bigger About the WordPress Economy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=101579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://poststatus.com/market-size-and-market-shares/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:326:\"$635.5 billion…That’s \"billion,\" with a “B.” Let\'s look at the size of the universe inhabited by our market of markets of cathedrals and bazaars: the WordPress ecosystem.

Meta contributors added a new &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">Block Themes</a>&#8221; menu item to the filter menu on the directory homepage, a solution that some classic theme developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-contributors-get-pushback-on-proposal-to-improve-block-themes-visibility-in-the-directory\">fought tooth and nail to discourage</a> in the ticket over the course of seven weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on Block Themes displays themes that have the <code>full-site-editing</code>&nbsp;feature tag. Previously, block themes were buried three clicks deep and users had to know how to find them through the feature filter. They are now easily accessible from the directory landing page. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although most WordPress themes support blocks in the content editor, the &#8220;block themes&#8221; identifier refers to themes that allow users to edit templates with blocks through the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the landscape of themes is changing, contributors have been working towards building a shared lexicon for how they refer to themes that support full-site editing. When the team updated the Theme Handbook prior to the WordPress 5.9 release, they settled on using the term &#8220;classic&#8221; for PHP-based themes and &#8220;block&#8221; for those that support full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes are about to cross a major milestone in the directory. At the time of publishing there are 99 block themes available, representing roughly 1% of the directory&#8217;s total number of themes. As part of the project’s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/01/21/big-picture-goals-2022/\">big picture goals for 2022</a>, WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy set 500 block themes as a goal for the community. The number is not even halfway there but the newly released <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-releases-new-plugin-for-creating-block-themes\">Create Block Theme</a> plugin should give it a boost, as it allows anyone to design a theme in the editor and export it for others to use.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 20:18:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:142:\"Post Status: WordPress Certifications, SVG Uploads, FSE Category Testing, Fortnightly NPM updates, Persistent Object Cache and Full Page Cache\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=101531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-certifications/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"What are your thoughts about WordPress certification?

In six years, the software has undergone a metamorphosis by adopting a new block paradigm that should be reflected in its website. Contributors are now looking at giving the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">homepage</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">download page</a> a design overhaul that showcases its new capabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since then, WordPress has seen a lot of changes, including the Gutenberg editor, Full Site Editor, block themes, and more,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing team rep Nicholas Garofalo said. &#8220;All of these have revolutionized WordPress in the past few years, and the brand is starting to modernize and evolve as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-news-gets-a-new-design\">launched design updates for the news</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/10/29/redesign-of-the-gutenberg-page/\">Gutenberg</a> pages. &#8220;There’s a ton of room to expand and evolve this look as we turn our attention to other parts of the site,&#8221; Garofalo said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The designers working on the project are particularly interested in hearing from WordPress.org users about what they want to see on the homepage, which means everyday users are welcome to contribute their thoughts and suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Download page <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210106091723/https://wordpress.org/download/\">used to prominently feature the download button at the top of the page</a>, but sometime in mid-January 2021, it was pushed further down below recommended hosts. This was presumably to help people who want to set up a self-hosted site but don’t know where to get started but doesn&#8217;t make sense for those who came there to download the software. A transparent approach to redesigning this page would be appreciated, as changes like this are not always publicly documented. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, only a handful of full-time contributors have weighed in on the upcoming redesign in the comments of the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’d love to see the design showcase the modernization of the site editor and layout capabilities – even going so far as to do things many haven’t seen before, while also taking a moment to use words to describe why WordPress is so important in site-building,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing contributor Dan Soschin said. &#8220;It provides freedom, empowerment, and democracy in publishing. And what’s more, you can be technical or not technical, and still achieve all your goals.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soschin also suggested that the Download page offer more of an explanation on what it takes to self-host WordPress by either posting steps or directing visitors to guides and resources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored design team contributor Javier Arce had a unique idea of making the page with patterns in sections that users can copy and paste into their own websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since the website is made using WordPress and it’ll have a refreshed and modern look, I think it would be very cool not only to advertise that fact (&#8216;hey, so this fantastic site you are on right now was made entirely with the software you came here to download!&#8217;)… but also to allow people to grab the patterns used for each section… maybe even from the page itself, in a sort of self-referential nod to the platform,&#8221; Arce said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several contributors commented requesting the homepage highlight the community, &#8220;since the vibrant, active WP community is such a huge differentiator,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing contributor Jonathan Pantani said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Aside from the power of the software itself and what it can do, there’s the whole community of people that have been coming together regularly to share in a movement,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored marketing contributor Lauren Stein said. &#8220;This currently feels like it’s downplayed. I think it would be wonderful if it were highlighted more.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project needs more diverse input from contributors across the ecosystem and regular WordPress users who visit the website.

The modules have been tested inside the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab plugin</a> and version 1.2.0 has them both in a state the team says is ready for merging into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is an example of what users might see on the Site Health screen if page caching is not detected:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The modules are extensible so hosting companies and developers can further customize the output that users see.

Those who have been waiting for more full-site editing-enabled themes that go beyond a simple blogging layout should have a look at Axton, as it  is suitable for a portfolio, photography showcase, or even a business website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme boasts more than 15 block patterns, 17 full-site editing (FSE) templates, and nine template parts. Users can showcase their work with Header media, Hero Content, and Featured Content patterns anywhere on the site. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The entirety of the <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/axton/\">theme&#8217;s demo</a> site is available in pieces as patterns, so users can drag and drop and mix and match them to suit their needs. Even the style guide can be placed in the content via a pattern. Axton&#8217;s header is also available as the &#8220;Header with Search Bar&#8221; pattern that places the blocks in a pre-designed arrangement that is perfectly responsive on different device sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After activating the theme, the Customize button launches the Site Editor with a homepage that nearly matches the demo so that users don&#8217;t have to start from a blank slate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some layout options that users might previously have implemented via a page template prior to FSE, are now available as customizable patterns. For example, Axton offers &#8220;Blog Sidebar on Left&#8221; and &#8220;Blog Sidebar on Right&#8221; patterns that can be placed within a template and users can easily manipulate the alignments, background color, typography, and more </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; pattern works with the Contact Form 7 plugin. Users are prompted to install it after placing the pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Axton includes 17 full-site editing templates and nine template parts that enable users to quickly make changes to the layouts of the front page, single posts, the blog page, search results, and more. It also includes a Blank template for a clean slate when creating completely custom pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Axton is a beautifully designed theme that gives users a strong starting point for launching a portfolio or business website with more flexibility and template options than most sites will ever need. Catch Themes also has a Pro plugin that includes custom blocks for a Case Study, Popup Video, Tabs, Masonry, Header Search, and a Skills Bar, along with advanced patterns like pricing tables, logo display, and testimonials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/themes/axton/#theme-instructions\">documentation</a> on the Catch Themes website for a tour of how to use the theme&#8217;s features. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/axton/\">Axton</a> is available for free from the WordPress Themes Directory.

Felix is a developer relations engineer at Google and a WordPress core committer. He&#8217;s the lead engineer for the Site Kit plugin for WordPress, and has been a regular contributor to WordPress for several years. He&#8217;s also been involved in the newly created WordPress performance team, which is trying to work out how WordPress can stay ahead of the performance curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the fact that WordPress&#8217; has share of the CMS market is very strong, third party CMSs like Wix and Shopify have been growing their customer base in recent years. As single platforms they can be very focused upon performance and don&#8217;t have to worry about the possible performance issues, which the plugin and theme architecture of WordPress brings. Is this something that we need to be concerned about? Are website clients beginning to ask more probing questions about performance? And is WordPress keeping up with the marketing and messaging?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also talks about why it&#8217;s important for the whole WordPress community to be thinking about performance when building any website. It&#8217;s no secret that Google and other search engines are very interested in making the web faster. And future rankings could well be boosted by having a performant site. So we talked through some of the ways that this can be achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about Felix&#8217;s career. The fact that there&#8217;s an emerging industry of people who are able to work exclusively on website performance and earn their living from this expertise. This could be in the writing of code, the optimization of assets, as well as the configuration of hosting options. Felix recommends some things which might be of use for people wishing to find out more. It&#8217;s an interesting conversation about an area which is going to matter more and more in the months and years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case with these WordCamp Europe interviews. We were competing against the crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcasts are more than listable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Felix Arntz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Felix Arntz. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Pretty great. It&#8217;s amazing to be back at the in person event. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There are 2000, I think 2,700 people and it actually feels like a lot more, but it&#8217;s a spectacular event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are working at Google. Am I right in saying that? What&#8217;s your role over at Google?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:13] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I&#8217;m a developer relations engineer, so yeah, I work on specifically focused on content management systems. Like of course WordPress, primarily. So yeah, I&#8217;m working in the, primarily in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:25] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> And, my two main projects currently are the Site Kit plugin, Google Site Kit plugin, which is, you may have heard of. It&#8217;s Google&#8217;s flagship plugin for WordPress and the new performance team, which was fairly recently formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you have a background in WordPress or were you Google first and then WordPress a bit later? Or was it WordPress first and Google later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I come from the WordPress community. My first WordCamp was WordCamp Europe seven years ago, and then I joined the contributor day and I got to contribute and really got hooked on doing that. I got my first props for WordPress Core contributions back then, and I never stopped contributing since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It, kind of feels like if you were to rewind the clock that far, maybe a bit further, that Google and WordPress, there wasn&#8217;t really a connection there. it was one of many CMSs, but maybe I&#8217;ve got the timeline wrong there, but it does feel now as if Google is treating WordPress very seriously indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, obviously with the market share being what it is, it&#8217;s good to get in there. Is that the case? Does it see WordPress as an important part of the ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I think historically it&#8217;s, it has not always been as much as that, as it has been since, I don&#8217;t know, 2017, 18, I think that&#8217;s where this really started. And yeah, that&#8217;s where Google started actively focusing more on WordPress. There had been smaller efforts here and there before, but that&#8217;s when it really started. And I started working for Google in the end of 2018, and with a few other people from the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, your involvement in WordCamp Europe is all about performance and, I would imagine most people, and I&#8217;m gonna say that me included basically, I don&#8217;t really understand it. I know that it&#8217;s important. I know that performance matters, and I know that everybody is, has been talking about it for the last, let&#8217;s say eighteen, twenty months, specifically around Core Web Vitals and things like that, where we, we suddenly felt like the sky was falling in and everything needed to be rebuilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How important, does it really matter? And what I mean by that is if I&#8217;m just starting up a local website for a local shop and I can sort of rely on traffic to come to that website. Does it have any impact at all, or is this really just about the search engine? The search results for Google? So I&#8217;m trying to strike a balance with where we need to apply the most effort. So for most people it would be designing the website in the first place and things like SEO possibly, and performance possibly they come much further down the pecking order of what they want to worry about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your insight? Is it super important or is it a thing that we can leave till a little bit later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I would say that performance and SEO have a little bit of similarity just in the sense that they both actually affect, they should affect, user experience. The end user experience of the people that visit the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So search engine optimization in that sense is a little bit of a misleading term I would argue, because of course you are optimizing for the search engine, but the search engines, the different search engines, they try to be, they try to have algorithms that as close as possible kind of represent how the user would experience the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you optimize for search engines, if you do it in the proper way you would also be optimizing for the end users. There&#8217;s of course those things like black hat SEO, where you stuff keywords, and that doesn&#8217;t do anything nice for end user. And that&#8217;s the way that you should not do SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you do improved performance, it now has, yeah, it has certain impact on the search engines, but mainly it is a priority because of the end user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So, this is a ridiculous question, but I&#8217;m gonna ask it anyway. What are the key bits, what are the key bits of the jigsaw that make up performance? If you were to put yourself in front of a typical WordPress user. So somebody who basically doesn&#8217;t really perhaps know anything about performance, what would be the things that you would say, okay, here&#8217;s the first two or three things that you need to be worrying about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:02] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I feel like at a high level a lot of people think about performance, just about how fast the page loads. That is probably, maybe the most essential of the different high level areas of what is performance. But I think it&#8217;s also, it is very important to, there&#8217;s two other, I would argue high level aspects, which are key for performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I take performance again, in that sense, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a major part of user experience. Another part of it is layout shifts. So I feel like everybody that&#8217;s probably listening to this has experienced this thing that they click on a button on a website and it, while they want to click the moment it clicks, it moves away and then you click on some ad instead or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe by design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:41] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Maybe yeah, yeah, sometimes. But yeah, this is a very bad user experience and not having this kind of experience is also contributing to a solid performance. I would really put performance to a degree similar with user experience. It&#8217;s a part of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third part to performance is how fast the page responds when you do something on it. If you scroll and it&#8217;s, if you move the scroll wheel and it scrolls four seconds later, that&#8217;s not great either. So those are the three tiers to performance, in my opinion. Like the loading performance, the avoiding layout shifts and how fast the page responds to your actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The beautiful thing about WordPress is that you can download WordPress and it basically comes vanilla. And you can throw as many things as you like on top of it, plugin, themes, blocks, increasingly and so on. And of course, each of those things has a, perhaps tiny, but maybe major impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel that it&#8217;s quite a difficult thing to understand in WordPress, what performance is. If you go to, and we&#8217;ll get onto this, we&#8217;ll develop this a bit later. If you go to a proprietary CMS, something where it&#8217;s a SaaS. You pay your fixed monthly fee or what have you, and they take care of all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing to worry about, but it seems like there&#8217;s a myriad of things, possibly dozens of things that you could do to your WordPress site. I feel that that&#8217;s a difficulty. That&#8217;s a problem that WordPress has got to overcome because there&#8217;s no one size fits all. No two WordPress sites are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s that puzzle of unpicking. Okay, on my site, what are the things that I need to do to address it? Do you think that is an actual problem? Have we got ourselves to the point where WordPress is, because of its nature, because you can throw anything at it. It&#8217;s more difficult to untangle that mess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Certainly yes. So I would say by the nature of WordPress that, because there&#8217;s endless possibilities. There&#8217;s endless possibilities to do whatever you want to do, but, there&#8217;s also endless possibilities to mess up performance or any, any best practice for that matter on your WordPress site, because you kind of have full control about everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In those other type of platforms, which like SaaS or proprietary or whatever you call them, yeah it&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s more controlled. It is a more controlled environment. You have a lot less options in what you can do. And another aspect is that in those systems, they&#8217;re usually maintained by a single company and that company builds the entire product. All the different aspects of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where in the WordPress ecosystem, there&#8217;s WordPress core. And then there&#8217;s 60,000 plugins, from probably 50,000 different people or companies. So they are not all aligned. I can tell you that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It does make it incredibly difficult to unpick because your combination of things will not be the same as my combination of things. And whilst there might be some broad outlines that you can do. And, I feel that in the WordPress space, a lot of that is sort of installing another thing to try and unpick all the other things that you did. So it might be a performance or a caching plugin or something like that, and the problem sort of gets worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although at this event, WordCamp Europe 2022, I would say it&#8217;s fair to say that most of the people here are fairly obsessed with WordPress. I would also hazard a guess that the vast majority of people that are using WordPress, have very little idea of what&#8217;s going on. You know, they, they probably know there&#8217;s some hosting accounts somewhere that they&#8217;ve used and whatever that tier is and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they know that they&#8217;re using WordPress, but they might not have any, any indication that, okay, you, you need to compress this, cache this and so on. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s difficult. And communicating that to people I think is gonna be a real challenge for wordpress.org in the future because the competition from the proprietary CMSs, the ones that you say where everything&#8217;s in one package. It&#8217;s hosted by them. It&#8217;s managed by them. The code is updated by them. They feel at the moment as if they&#8217;re kind of winning the race a little bit in terms of performance. Is that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:19] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah, like some of those, proprietary CMSs, they are indeed ahead of WordPress in terms of performance, but largely due to them having less of this complexity that we are facing with WordPress. But also not only WordPress, like other open source CMSs, like Drupal, Joomla and so forth, they are facing similar challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the next piece for me is the approach that WordPress has taken. And a few years ago it was decided that performance was enough of a thing that a team need needed to be created. And my understanding is that you are part of that team. What&#8217;s its remit? What&#8217;s its objectives? What&#8217;s its goal? And I realize that you&#8217;re at the beginning of this journey. So it may be that you&#8217;re just trying to flesh out what that looks like. But just give us an idea of what it is, what the goals are and how many people are involved at this point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> So the team actually only came up in fall or so last year. Probably the early conversation started sometime summer last. It was an initiative that came from different contributors. Several, like the way that usually WordPress teams, new WordPress teams are formed is that a group of people or people from companies or individual contributors get together and say, we need to do something about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically in this, me and other people from my team were involved in together with contributors from Yoast and XWP, 10up, we all kind of got together and thought like, we need to do something about performance. Started in through initial conversations and at some point we formed a proposal that we published at makewordpress.org that there should be an official WordPress performance team that can focus on those aspects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an accessibility team. There&#8217;s a security team. There should also be a performance team. And as similar to those other two teams, to really have a focus group for this area, that goes across the different disciplines. Like not only Core, but also plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how the performance team started. It has been very well received from the very beginning. Uh, there was a lot of support on the initial posts. That was amazing to see that a lot of people in the WordPress community, they were happy to see that and they cared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, yeah, I would say the team&#8217;s formation so far has been quite successful. We started, setting up weekly meetings on Slack where we discussed where we&#8217;re gonna focus on. And a lot of contributors have showed up since, and contributed to our efforts, to the team&#8217;s efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And I presume you&#8217;re wide open to anybody that&#8217;s listening to this that wants to get stuck in as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:38] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Oh, absolutely. We have a booth here at WordCamp Europe, which is also really exciting, like at the community area there&#8217;s a performance booth this time and we would love to have anybody who&#8217;s interested to join our meetings</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Tell me how it&#8217;s been received. There&#8217;s all the other booths as well. Have you been receiving the same amount of visitors coming to you and talking and trying to figure things out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:58] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah, there has been a large number of people that were interested in coming, stopping by asking about. And some people have heard about the initiative before and they just wanna to hear a bit more about it. Some people come with very concrete ideas, like, hey, we should do this in the performance team. Other people haven&#8217;t heard about it yet, and that&#8217;s great too. Like, so far, yeah, the reception has been very positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So what are the ideas that you are coalescing around? What are the things that are coming up in your Slack channel and maybe that came up in the last 24 hours or so? What are the things that you&#8217;ve decided, okay, we&#8217;re gonna tackle it in this order. Here&#8217;s the first two, three, whatever things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> So, look at it from a higher level. I think we have with the performance team, there is different layers to improve. And the main thing that we have been focusing on so far is improving performance in WordPress Core, different aspects of WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the one aspect. Another one is to, improve or to make available tools, to measure performance specifically for WordPress, in a WordPress context. Through that basically, raise more awareness or make it easier, even for plugin or theme developers to test performance of their plugins or themes and determine where there are any problems and how can those be fixed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s another aspect and overall, raising more awareness of performance and making metric based performance decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It feels to me like the WordPress Core bit is the low hanging fruit, because there it is. You&#8217;ve got it in front of you and you can figure out what it is that needs to be tweaked and so on. And so presumably work, whether it&#8217;s begun or not, I don&#8217;t know, but presumably work will begin on that at some point. And then as you say, it&#8217;s about educating the community and I feel that&#8217;s going quite well actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I obsess about WordPress and so I&#8217;m constantly looking around, but it does feel like there&#8217;s a lot more messaging about that coming out. Maybe that&#8217;s to do with Core Web Vitals and things and so on and so forth. I wondered about partnerships as well, because a big part of this whole jigsaw piece is the thing that the WordPress site sits on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, you know, you may have hosting over here for $3 99 a month or something, or you may be spending a hundred dollars a month and that kind of piece presumably, would be at some point needed to be addressed. Talking to the hosting companies and so on making partnerships and giving them the benefit of whatever insights you&#8217;ve managed to figure out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:06] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Absolutely. There are some people who are from the hosting team there, from the WordPress hosting team are also involved in the performance team. And, I can say not a lot has happened on that side yet, but that is certainly an aspect where we wanna do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we have already. So far, we&#8217;ve mostly reached out to hosting providers for specific feedback on certain things that we wanted to do in WordPress Core to get more research and more information on that. But I think what you&#8217;re saying, I definitely see that coming up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of Google&#8217;s contribution. Google traditionally over the last few years, certainly since I&#8217;ve been attending these large events, Google&#8217;s been a real key sponsor. And you&#8217;re helping with the Site Kit initiative. Just tell us about that. Maybe just dwell on the complexity of that and all of the different pieces that fit into place, because I&#8217;ve heard about it. I briefly took a look at it right at the beginning when it came out and it&#8217;s fresh and new, but I haven&#8217;t really done much with it since then. So I need educating on what&#8217;s in there and where it&#8217;s gone in the last few months or years even.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> So Site Kit is very much separate from the performance team. That has, has been the product which I started on, started working on from my very beginning at Google. it&#8217;s basically, Google&#8217;s, Google&#8217;s flagship product which helps you to use the popular Google tools that help you succeed as a web creator, right within your WordPress site. And one of the things that really helps with its onboarding to all those tools, like search console, analytics, AdSense to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always this complexity that in order to set up those tools on your site, you often have to paste some snippet somewhere in your WordPress site, and then it&#8217;s like a lot of people put this in their themes&#8217; functions.php, and then you update the theme and it&#8217;s gone. Or like, unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing there, there&#8217;s lots of ways to mess that up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that Site Kit really does for you is make this super straightforward, like make a couple clicks and it all takes care of that for you because it&#8217;s in the WordPress site, it connects directly to the Google APIs. Sets up those those services for you. And then it displays the relevant metrics right within your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can manage it all from your WordPress site. You can still go to the Google services of course, to see like the full picture of all the stats, but you can see the most, what we consider the most important metrics, you can see them in your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it basically pulls all of the bits and pieces, all the important data from the Google properties. And just puts them inside the dashboard as if you&#8217;ve gone out to look at, I dunno, analytics dot Google dot com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Right. Yeah. One thing that is also special about it is that it has connection to all of those services. In the Google services, you have to go to one service or the other or the other, but in Site Kit has a dashboard that combines the metrics from all of them. There is definitely like a long term goal to also correlate them more. Like we have also connection to Page Speed Insights, which that is a part of Site Kit, which has more, a little bit more of course, like overlap with performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a page speed module and, eventually it would be amazing if we can somehow explain to site owners how like performance, this page, let&#8217;s make an example. Like this URL has a way better web vitals performance value than other ones and see how it&#8217;s much better performing in terms of the number of conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel like that&#8217;s the missing bit for me. The connection between all of this work and any benefit. Because I never see the benefit from the work, because you know, you put in the time and you, compress this thing and you do that thing, but there&#8217;s no sort of direct comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could, for example, quickly and easily in my WordPress dashboard go, okay, that thing that I did over there, it&#8217;s been up there for a month now and I can see that it&#8217;s had this effect. Yeah. That&#8217;s really useful. It&#8217;s a great big endorsement I think from the giant that is Google to put all of this time and effort into a WordPress thing. I don&#8217;t know if you do that on other CMSs or other platforms as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:39] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I mean, we have been involved with other CMSs, like Typo3 Drupal, Joomla. The team that I&#8217;m part of, mostly with open source, open source CMSs. WordPress has a bit more attention because of its yeah, its meaning, its importance and popularity on the web. One of the things that we are seeing is that fewer users use the traditional web, which is what WordPress is part of. And more and more users use apps and we think it&#8217;s vital that, to get a little more of this attention from people back to the web, it has to match the apps in the experience and the performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that what is behind all of this push because, I mean, the, the apps on your phone, they are just breathtakingly, amazing. You know, the capabilities that are in iOS and Android and the way that they behave and the animations and things. They&#8217;re just all baked into the OS and they look beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I completely identify with why would you go to, as an example, why would you go to twitter.com if you could have the Twitter app? And so that, I guess is what you&#8217;re saying that at some point, parity between the two, the web is in every way as capable and performant as the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:44] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Right, right. Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I feel like we&#8217;re a long way away from that at the minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:48] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yes we are. And that&#8217;s where, that&#8217;s why Google overall is interested in this and Google would like to succeed. Would like to see the web succeed. Cause it, of course it is important for Google, but it is also important for WordPress. So I would argue in this sense and, I care. I have always been part of the WordPress ecosystem and I, I am a fan of WordPress, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t be here. And, uh, I think that in this sense I would argue that the interest of WordPress and Google in that sense overlap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting because on my phone I&#8217;m really addicted to the way that the animation is is smooth and the way that I might scroll something up and something will compress. So there&#8217;s animations there. And yet it&#8217;s kind of like the polar opposite on the web we&#8217;re being told no, no, get rid of all of that sort of stuff. You know, compress the images don&#8217;t have any animation where you don&#8217;t need it, and so on. They are quite different things. And I guess it&#8217;s the browser, that&#8217;s the bottleneck?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:34] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I, I would argue there&#8217;s, the more of those things you do, the harder it gets to keep good performance. Having good performance is hard. And, uh, if you have an empty WordPress site out of the box, it has amazing performance, but you add 10 plugins to it and a ton of content and that changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> To develop that a little bit, what I was meaning is on the phone, it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter how much of those animations and things they throw at it. It still just is performant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I really don&#8217;t know where the difference there is, whether the browser is incapable of handling that level of load, or if it&#8217;s just that the, the operating system, iOS, Android, or what have you you can cope more. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:08] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I would argue that quite a bit of it is that, you can do a lot of those nicer animations on the web too. And, if you do it yeah, with CSS, it can still be fast. But usually there&#8217;s other things involved that make the website slow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can do these animations with CSS, you should not try to do them with JavaScript, for example. Especially like Java, loading a lot of JavaScript is one of the prime offenders of good performance on sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> A couple of years ago, actually, you may need to correct me. When did the whole concept of Core Web Vitals, when did that all really begin? It feels like two years to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:42] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah. Maybe I, I can&#8217;t even say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s about, it&#8217;s roughly, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s two years. Everybody was obsessed with that. It really did feel like it was a you know, line in the sound where everybody was right, if it doesn&#8217;t meet all of these metrics, hell is gonna freeze over. Your website won&#8217;t be ranked anymore. Equally, it never felt to me that that moment ever arrived. I didn&#8217;t really see that the sites that I&#8217;d been building hit too badly, even though there wasn&#8217;t a lot of remedial work that I did. Was that just a load of hype or did that stuff really affect the SERPs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:12] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I mean this was prioritized. The Core Web Vitals um, were prioritized by Google, of course, because we had to raise more awareness of that performance on the web is not going so great. And the site owners and developers and whoever is involved in websites, they should, they need to do something about it to improve performance. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know much about like how they affect search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I was gonna say, if you knew how the search results were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:35] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Oh yeah. Yeah, lot of people would ask me a lot of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right. You&#8217;d be locked in this room and pounded by questions, yeah. You&#8217;ve managed to make a career out of WordPress and performance. So firstly, well done for that. If that&#8217;s the thing that you were aiming at, that&#8217;s really amazing. Secondly, I wonder if the whole performance thing is there like a bonafide career in the future. In the same way that people, I dunno, 20 years ago, there were no people who were SEO consultants. It was just not a thing. And then suddenly people thought, oh, do you know what, there&#8217;s a job there, there&#8217;s enough work to be done to make that a job and we can get paid for doing that. Do you think that would be the case for people like you? You could be a freelance performance person?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:13] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> I feel like that is already a thing to a degree. It&#8217;s probably has blurry lines, like where you are like, I would recommend that, if any developer should try to familiarize themselves with the performance best practices and build that knowledge and improve this knowledge over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it is important to consider performance in every, in every step while you develop your products or plugins or themes, and similar to how this with accessibility and security, they have to be part of the whole design process at all times. But I would to your point, I also can see how I think there&#8217;re already a bunch of people that, that have specific strength in their knowledge in performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe they&#8217;re still developers or maybe they could also be end users that know a ton about performance and help other site owners to improve it. Yeah, I think that is already a thing. but I, I could definitely see it growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It feels like a tunnel that you could go down and you could really be an expert in that and sort of separate yourself and maybe find a career which didn&#8217;t always involve, I don&#8217;t know, building the entire site. You might just advise on that particular component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:11] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah Yeah. I think one of the things I wanna say, like in order to get started with that, uh, some of the tools that help you measure performance, they can be really helpful I would say. Because a lot of us, including myself, we don&#8217;t know all of these performance best practices. It is a ton to think about based on what you&#8217;re doing. Yeah, there are a lot of different tools to measure performance and give you recommendations. What you need to improve?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s very valuable to learn from those and internalize that knowledge that you get from running your site through one of, through some of these tools. And then from there you can think about how can I actually address this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, Felix, sadly, we&#8217;re out of time. So I&#8217;m gonna say thank you very much for chatting to me today. I appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:48] <strong>Felix Arntz:</strong> Yeah, thank you.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Do The Woo Community: devlife_snippet: WooDev Profile, Marius Vetrici\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72250\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://dothewoo.io/devlife-snippet-woodev-profile-marius-vetrici/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:417:\"<p>WooCommerce was and is very cool thanks to being open source.

These included the possibility of changing the popular themes algorithm to more prominently feature block themes, and/or adding a new &#8220;Block&#8221; menu item next to Popular and Latest on the themes directory home page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The directory is going through some growing pains as themes that are compatible with the site editor are the only ones that offer access to everything WordPress has to offer in the new paradigm of blocks. Yet, the 94 available block themes represent fewer than 1% of the directory&#8217;s 9,761 themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting time in WordPress&#8217; history where the theme a user selects can significantly limit the ability to take advantage of WordPress&#8217; latest features. This is why some contributors are proposing that block themes get more visibility in the directory. It directly impacts FSE adoption and consequently its improvement, as people using it is the pathway to better quality feedback that will shape its future in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After five weeks the ticket went silent, following WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse&#8217;s recommendation that re-doing the front page of the directory would likely be the best way to solve the needs communicated in the ticket. Two weeks ago the discussion was reignited  when WordPress theme developer and Themes Team contributor Dumitru Brinzan <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6330#comment:19\">commented</a> with strong opposition to the idea of promoting block themes: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>This goes against everything</strong> that was discussed about the role of themes in the past 10 years at least.</p><p>In the past there have been a lot of instances when a new tab with themes, a different algorithm, a different order, different X, Y, Z have been appropriate.</p><p>Every single time theme authors heard the same song: it is not the role of .org to promote or market any particular product. It is not the role of .org to make the themes repo look like the plugins repo.</p><p>The logical request of removing the default Twenty themes from the Popular tab fell on deaf years.</p><p>But now there&#8217;s a new shiny toy (that is not even ready or wanted by the general public).<br />And suddenly people with a direct interest in having a spotlight on their themes are pushing this &#8220;new&#8221; idea.</p><p>This is a spit in the face of the hundreds (if not thousands) of theme authors that have been contributing to .org until now.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Themes Team contributor Sarah Norris <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress.org/pull/85\">submitted a PR</a> that adds a &#8216;Block&#8217; tab to the Theme Directory filter list. It filters themes using the full-site-editing tag, which is currently buried three clicks deep for those who know how to apply the filter. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />source: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress.org/pull/85\">PR to Add Block tab to filter list</a>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These types of themes are more commonly referred to as block themes, so by adding this tag, we are reducing the confusion between these terms and making it clearer how to filter by block themes in the directory,&#8221; Norris said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse concluded that the PR was &#8220;the most straight forward way forward here, making the most impact today,&#8221; but questioned whether &#8220;block&#8221; is the best term to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian Zumbrunnen, another participant in the discussion, suggested classic themes get a label as well, such as &#8220;Classic,&#8221; which could be changed to &#8220;Deprecated&#8221; sometime in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And another question: why would my non-FSE themes built for the Block Editor be relegated to the &#8216;classic themes&#8217; category?&#8221; Brinzan said. &#8220;Why give priority specifically to FSE themes, all the while calling them &#8216;block&#8217; themes? My classic themes work perfectly well with blocks. Why create any more confusion under the false pretense of making things &#8216;easier and clearer?\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference here is that while most themes now support the block editor for content, very few include full support for the block-based site editor. Brinzan contends that contributors should work towards creating a more efficient search and improving the browsing/filtering experience for themes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The whole directory needs to be improved. It&#8217;s not right (or fair) to prioritize one type of themes, when many of them aren&#8217;t even production-ready.<br />Funneling all WordPress users towards an unfinished and clunky product won&#8217;t do anyone any good. WordPress is not known for its elegant UI, and this will make things worse. WordPress users are not guinea pigs to force Gutenberg and FSE on them at every step. Let this process take its natural course.<br /></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress theme developers are facing the inevitable task of updating their themes to be FSE-enabled in order to remain relevant in the new era of using blocks to edit all aspects of a WordPress site. Themes that don&#8217;t support the full range of the platform&#8217;s features do not have long before they become the last vestiges of a bygone era of WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hendrik Luehrsen, who agreed that full-site editing themes should be easier to find, said he is concerned about how to do that without &#8220;without downgrading the rest of the themes or without creating an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect\">Osborne Effect</a>.&#8221; This notion, which is based on the downfall of the Osborne Computer Corporation, particularly affects consumer electronic products where prematurely announcing the imminent release of a technologically superior product can damage the sales of existing products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Osborne Effect may not be applicable in this case, since WordPress has already shipped FSE to those who want to take advantage of it, and block themes, the successor of legacy WordPress themes, are already here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Themes Team contributor Jeffrey Pearce <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6330#comment:59\">urged contributors to reach a consensus</a> and reminded them that the solution can always be iterated on later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to highlight that block themes can only get better with improved exposure by usage, which seems to be what most folks in here agree on,&#8221; Pearce said. &#8220;The solutions in this ticket don&#8217;t seek to demote classic themes, but rather they seek to improve the discoverability of Block Themes instead of the current filter approach.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 05:27:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:144:\"HeroPress: Finding a second chance in life through WordPress – വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സിലൂടെ ജീവിതവിജയം\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4542\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-a-second-chance-in-life-through-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=finding-a-second-chance-in-life-through-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83250:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071122-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: If I have achieved anything in life today, it is thanks to WordPress and its community.\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#malayalam\">ഈ ഉപന്യാസം മലയാളത്തിലും ലഭ്യമാണ്</a></p>\n\n\n\nHere is Hari reading his own story aloud.\n\n\n\n<p>I will never forget the day I turned 22. I was officially at the lowest point in life as I woke up that morning. While my peers were employed with multinational companies or pursuing higher education at top universities worldwide, I had just been fired from my first “job” and was broke. Things were so bad that I had even become a pariah in my own family. Setting aside all those negative thoughts, I pulled myself out of my bed and switched on my computer, which lit up with a partly-written blog post on the TinyMCE editor of WordPress 3.0.1. That sight filled me with hope. I felt a strong creative urge to continue writing and started typing away. After completing that post, I leaned on my chair, marveling at my creation. All my negative emotions had now disappeared. I realized that even if I failed in life, I would always have two things with me &#8211; my blog and the open source software that powered it (WordPress). And that was all I needed to trudge onward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little did I know that this open source software (that powers 40%+ of all websites in the world today) would eventually become my <em>raison d&#8217;être</em> and give me a life I could never even dream of!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-discovering-wordpress\">Discovering WordPress&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram, in Kerala, India as an only child to engineer parents. Since computers and programming had always fascinated me as a kid, I enrolled in an engineering course with a specialization in information technology after high school. My goal was to take up a career in technology. I even had lofty dreams of pursuing research in computer science. My batch had a four-month break before college started, and during this time, I started working with my friends’ web services startup. One evening, while working on a client’s website, I was introduced to WordPress. It was a revelation. You could create and customize websites from an admin panel without needing to hand-code in HTML! I loved it and wanted to create a WordPress website on my own. However, since I did not have the resources to purchase a domain and hosting package, I did the next best thing &#8211; I set up a blog on WordPress.com.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the cliche goes, that was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. :)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-thriving-with-wordpress-during-tough-times\">Thriving with WordPress during tough times</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, the holidays were over, and college started. With high hopes, I stepped foot into one of Kerala’s top engineering colleges. However, within a few days, I realized that I was a misfit in this system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian educational system is designed for rote-learning by default and rejects everyone that does not comply. My ‘radical’ dreams of thinking out of the box, finding knowledge outside prescribed textbooks, exploring the practical side of concepts, and even furthering original ideas &#8211; made me an outcast. I was disappointed, disillusioned, and eventually lost interest in academics. To add insult to the injury, my friends kicked me out of the web services startup, which was my saving grace during this ordeal. During this challenging time, it was WordPress that kept me going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pouring my mind into my WordPress blog helped me survive the trauma of college. Fueled by curiosity, I tried to find practical applications of core computer science concepts taught in college by tinkering with WordPress code and creating mock websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Slowly I started earning pocket money through freelance projects and Google AdSense. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I eventually bought my own domain and moved to self-hosted WordPress. All-in-all, WordPress not only helped me survive college but taught me more than college ever could. By the end of four years, I had learned PHP, MySQL, web designing and development, open source philosophy, and even became a better writer thanks to WordPress! Even as the nightmare called college went on by the side, I collected a bunch of professional accolades. The most memorable ones include <a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/india/2009-March/001497.html\">being an honorary speaker at one of India’s top engineering colleges</a>, getting a chance to <a href=\"https://harishanker.net/2009/06/richard-stallman-interview/\">interview Richard Stallman</a> himself, <a href=\"http://www.mindful.org/student-wins-mindful-leadership-award/\">winning an international essay competition</a>, and becoming a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Hari-Shanker-R-/\">freelance journalist with one of India’s national newspapers</a>. Life was challenging but promising!</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1_Presenting_at-NITC-scaled.jpg\"><img /></a><em>Presenting at NIT Calicut &#8211; one of India’s top engineering colleges, as an invited speaker</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2_Mindful_Leadership.jpg\"><img /></a><em>Selected as a runner-up for Mindful Leadership co-organized by University of Dayton, Ohio and Loyola Institute of Business Administration</em>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-finding-out-about-automattic\">Finding out about Automattic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for WordPress encouraged me to add a question about <a href=\"https://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the co-founder of WordPress, in a trivia quiz that I hosted at an intercollegiate quiz in my third year. The question went unanswered, but while preparing for the quiz, I <a href=\"https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-01-27-wordpress-creator-blog_N.htm\">learned</a> about Matt’s company &#8211; <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic, Inc</a>. Automattic owned WordPress.com and had 30+ employees working remotely from all corners of the world then. Since WordPress was <em>everything </em>to me, working for the company that runs WordPress.com felt like a dream. I believed that I had a real shot at making it to Automattic; since it was a fully distributed company, I could work remotely from India without having to worry about work permits or visas. The “<a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/job/happiness-engineer/\">Happiness Engineer</a>” role seemed like a perfect fit for me, and I decided to apply right after graduating from college a year later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IwEYKJ0aWaB0VfHnBxrpnLwaKjJmsirO438qSNescoNrcfLMMsHGUH1mH1rzmQ5tNhhCem0dmRCGEDsM0D11HKW6CWKSsAT8pGEvGaq43wEQQJBxUKAxforW8D-WQASsKx7HxvivecECzg1ybyU\" alt=\"\" /><em>A glimpse from the same quiz that I hosted where I would shortly ask that question about Matt that would go unanswered!</em>\n\n\n\n<p>However, life would have other plans for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-dreams-come-crashing-down-but-not-without-hope\">Dreams come crashing down &#8211; but not without hope!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>History teaches us that every misfit meets debilitating failure early on in life. After surviving for nearly three and a half years, my crash came in my final year. Since I lacked the minimum attendance, I did not graduate with my batchmates and was asked to repeat my last semester with my juniors. It was a major blow &#8211; not just for my ego, but also for my existence. Nevertheless, I did not lose hope. I decided to stay engaged during the six-month gap before my final semester classes restarted and signed up as a journalist with a local web portal. However, before I would complete two full months in this “job”, I got fired. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>That was the last nail in my coffin. I lost every ounce of hope. I started hearing voices in my head accusing me of being a failure. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I was officially branded as a loser as <em>everyone</em> started ridiculing me for my plight, left, right, and center. A psychiatrist, who happens to be a family friend, diagnosed me with clinical depression and prescribed medicines with extreme side effects that made me feel worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only one ‘person’ stood by me through thick and thin with unwavering faith &#8211; and that was WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It slowly dawned upon me that even if I failed everywhere else, I knew WordPress inside out. I had the confidence to do anything and everything with it; thus giving me a real shot at a proper career. I started freelancing full-time. I was not earning a ton of money, but freelancing helped me pay my bills. I started gaining confidence as I got more and more good reviews for my work. No one knew about my “job” and I did not bother to change that perception as well. My parents would sneer at me for wasting my time spending hours in front of the computer instead of studying or applying for jobs when I was <em>actually</em> working and earning <em>real </em>money! College was soon done and dusted. I consulted a more qualified mental health professional who confirmed my original suspicion that I was misdiagnosed by the psychiatrist and took me out of medicines. I slowly started getting back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after that, WordPress led me to my first ‘real’ job as a Project Manager with a multinational startup based in Kochi. My primary responsibility at this company was to oversee a network of WordPress websites, and it was a job I thoroughly enjoyed. Being honored and respected for my skills and abilities proved to be a game-changer for me. Over time, I also saw my life improve slowly and steadily. I soon found myself working as a banker in a public sector bank in India. During this time, I met the love of my life, and we got married and started living on our terms. Since I was working in the bank, I was not using WordPress for work anymore. However, my Twitter bio still had a “WordPress guru” moniker. I would keep tinkering with WordPress in my free time, as working with WordPress always brought me joy. The bank job was not making me happy, and I started thinking of the next step in my career.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-automattic-beckons\">Automattic beckons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was at this stage that my mind naturally went back to Automattic. After I discovered the company in my third year, I would visit their <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">jobs page</a> at least a hundred times in the next six years. I came close to applying several times but always stopped in my tracks due to raging self-doubt. I was still quite the <em>persona non grata</em> in both my immediate and extended family and was being mocked everywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>The only person who believed in me was my wife &#8211; <a href=\"https://archanamohan.com/\">Archana</a>. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, I confessed my desire to work at Automattic to her. She held my hand, looked firmly into my eyes, and spoke with conviction: <em>“You are going to make it to Automattic; I will bet my life on it.” </em>To this day, Archana continues to be my pillar of support and my biggest fan &#8211; the rest of what you are going to read would simply not have happened, had it not been for Archana’s iron-willed faith in me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/4_First_ever_WP_Swag.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>Sporting my first ever WordPress swag!</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5_Archana_Hari_Berlin.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>With Archana, my wife!</em>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to take Automattic seriously and started preparing. Since I had lost touch with WordPress, I started tinkering with WordPress more and built lots of WP websites. I also used my free time to work in the WordPress.org and WordPress.com forums. Interestingly, working at the bank helped me gain support skills that I lacked previously for the role that I aimed to apply for (Happiness Engineer), so I started feeling more and more confident about applying. Even after nine years as a WordPress user, I had never really explored its community, and I had the pleasure of discovering it on social media at that point. I was fascinated by a Twitter account, curiously named “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/heropress/\">HeroPress</a>” &#8211; which followed me back as soon as I followed it. I visited <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">https://heropress.com</a> that evening and went down a rabbit hole of inspirational WordPress stories. I read about several people who found success due to my favorite open source software, including many folks from my corner of the world. HeroPress was the inspiration I finally needed and was a key milestone in my WordPress journey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was now all set to apply, and I couldn’t help but wonder &#8211; would I get the chance to write about my journey on this very website, someday?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-a-dream-come-true\">A dream come true</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After three months of dedicated preparation, I finally bit the bullet and applied for the Happiness Engineer role at Automattic, in November 2015. I heard back from the Automattic hiring team within three weeks and went on to complete a series of interviews and tasks, which was followed by a paid trial. In February 2016, three months after I got my first email from the Automattic hiring team, Matt Mullenweg (yes, the same person who I created a quiz question on, seven years back) gave me an offer to work at Automattic as a full-time Happiness Engineer after a two-hour text-chat interview over Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had just watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454921/\">The Pursuit of Happyness</a> (again) a few days back and the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56fngopihOo\"> final scene from the movie</a> came to my mind, that very moment Matt gave me the offer…</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/6_was-it-as-easy.jpeg\"><img /></a></div>\n\n\n<p>The next few moments were a blur. I was on top of the world! I clearly remember hugging my wife tight &#8211; we both could not control our tears and wept with joy for several minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>There were situations in the past when I was so frustrated that I thought of calling it quits, unable to bear the pain and suffering. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Not too long ago, I used to be derided by my peers and my own family for my academics and my failures on a daily basis. Some people did not even bother to mince words &#8211; I was branded as a <em>“good-for-nothing idiot who brings nothing but shame to our family”</em>. My own parents had even asked me several times to <em>“drop out of college and consider blue-collar jobs and unskilled labor because that is the only thing you are worthy of!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here I was, the black sheep of my family, beaming with a signed offer letter for my dream job at my dream company! All thanks to an open source software built by contributors all over the world that stood by me through thick and thin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-story-continues\">The story continues</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of my life, the past six years, feels like a dream even today. I still pinch myself sometimes to see if this is indeed real. Today, I have evolved into a better human being, a capable professional, and a leader. The very first week of joining Automattic in April 2016, I flew to Austin, TX to attend a team meetup with my colleagues &#8211; there was a time in my life when I could barely imagine boarding a domestic flight, let alone flying to the United States! I have lost count of the number of times I have traveled around the world in the past six years &#8211; I have friends in every nook and corner of the world and have had the privilege of having some of the best experiences in life, thanks to my travels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7_In_Austin_With_Teammates-scaled.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>Stopping traffic at South Congress near Austin Downtown with my teammates at Automattic!&nbsp;</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/8_Hari_Lisbon-scaled.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>A picture with my teammates at Automattic in Lisbon Portugal, at a team meetup</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/9_A8cGM_Whistler.jpg\"><img /></a><em>At a photobooth with my teammates at the Automattic Grand Meetup in Whistler, Canada in 2017</em>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/10_Bubble_Football.png\"><img /></a><em>After a fun game of Bubble Football with my team in Barcelona, Spain</em>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for WordPress got me involved with the global WordPress community. I started by organizing local meetups in the city of Kochi (where we moved after I joined Automattic) and went on to organize three WordCamps and scores of meetup events. I also started translating WordPress to Malayalam (my native language) in my free time. I also got involved in the WordPress Community in India and made many great friends &#8211; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/adityakane\">Aditya</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajay-aravind/\">Ajay</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajithrn/\">Ajith</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/gounder/\">Alex</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aravindajith/\">Aravind</a>,  <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mbigul/\">Bigul</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hardeepasrani/\">Hardeep</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpcustomizer/\">Hitha</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kcjagadeep/\">Jagadeep</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/josevarghese/\">Jose</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nejwrks/\">Nebu</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nitkr/\">Nithin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rohittm/\">Rohit</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sheebaabraham/\">Sheeba</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yoga1103/\">Yogesh</a>… the list is too long for this essay, believe me!

In April 2020, I went through an internal hiring process and switched roles to become a Community Wrangler, working full-time on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Make/WordPress Community Team</a>, as one of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/automattic/\">Automattic’s Five for the Future contributors</a>. Over the past two years, I realized that working with the community is my true calling. Supporting our events program, even while navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic made me realize how much our community loves WordPress. It has equally been a privilege and a humbling experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From January through March 2022, I was selected to lead my team in Automattic, where I helped onboard four new team members that we hired. Leading our team for three months continues to be the best professional experience I have had so far. Earlier in 2022, I was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/01/03/announcement-team-representatives-for-2022/\">selected as the Team Representative for the Make/WordPress Community team</a>, and we just supported a vibrant team of local and global community organizers to host one of the biggest WordPress events in the world &#8211; <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp Europe 2022</a>. As I am writing this essay, I am enjoying my sabbatical at Automattic (all Automatticians that have completed five years working for Automattic are eligible for a paid, three-month sabbatical).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/16_My_Current_a8c_team-scaled.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>With my current team at Barcelona, Spain, in April 2022</em>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/17_WCEU2022_Community_Team_table.jpeg\"><img /></a><em>Introducing the Community Team on stage at WordCamp Europe 2022</em></div>\n\n\n<p>It has been 16 years since I first started using WordPress. In other words, WordPress has been a part of my life for nearly half of it. My mind still goes back to that morning on my 22nd birthday. Even though I had lost all hope, I clung to WordPress with both my arms. I had never even imagined that it would give me a life that I could barely dream of. But even in my darkest days, this open source software and its community gave me hope and pushed me forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I have achieved anything in life today, it is thanks to WordPress and its community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I will <em>forever</em> be grateful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"malayalam\">വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സിലൂടെ ജീവിതവിജയം</h1>\n\n\n\nഹരി തന്റെ കഥ ഉറക്കെ വായിക്കുന്നത് നിങ്ങൾക്ക് കേൾക്കാം.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<p>എനിക്ക് 22 വയസ്സ് തികഞ്ഞ ആ ദിവസം ഒരിക്കലും മറക്കാനാകില്ല. കാരണം, ജീവിതത്തിലെ ഏറ്റവും മോശം ഘട്ടത്തിൽ ആയിരുന്നു അന്ന് ഞാൻ. രാവിലെ ഉറക്കമുണർന്നപ്പോൾ മനസ്സാകെ കലുഷിതമായിരുന്നു. കൂടെ പഠിച്ചവരൊക്കെ വലിയ മൾട്ടിനാഷണൽ കമ്പനികളിൽ ജോലിക്കോ ഉപരിപഠനത്തിനായി വിദേശ സർവ്വകലാശാലകളിലേക്കോ പോയി തുടങ്ങിയപ്പോൾ ഞാനാകട്ടെ ആദ്യ ജോലിയിൽ നിന്നും പിരിച്ചു വിടപ്പെട്ട്, കൈയിൽ പത്ത് പൈസ ഇല്ലാത്ത ദുരവസ്ഥയിലായിരുന്നു. ചുരുക്കി പറഞ്ഞാൽ, വീട്ടുകാർക്കും നാട്ടുകാർക്കും വേണ്ടാത്ത, വെറുക്കപ്പെട്ട ഒരു ജന്മം! വിഷമങ്ങളൊക്കെ ഉള്ളിലൊതുക്കി വച്ച്, ഒരു വിധം ഞാൻ നേരെ കംപ്യൂട്ടറിന്റെ മുന്നിൽ നിലയുറപ്പിച്ചു. സ്‌ക്രീനിൽ അതാ WordPress 3.0.1 ഇന്റെ TinyMCE എഡിറ്ററും, അതിൽ ആംഗലേയത്തിൽ പാതിയെഴുതിയ ഒരു ബ്ലോഗ് പോസ്റ്റും, പതിയെ തെളിഞ്ഞു വന്നു. ആ കാഴ്ച കണ്ടപ്പോൾ മനസ്സിൽ പ്രതീക്ഷയുടെ ഒരു കണിക വന്നത് പോലെ. എവിടുന്നോ ഏതോ ശക്തി ഞരമ്പുകളിൽ ഞാൻ പോലുമറിയാതെ വന്നു കയറിയ പ്രതീതി. ആ ശക്തി മുറുകെപിടിച്ച്‌ ഞാൻ വേഗത്തിൽ ടൈപ്പ് ചെയ്തു തുടങ്ങി. താമസിയാതെ ആ പോസ്റ്റ് ഞാൻ എഴുതി പൂർത്തിയാക്കി. കസേരയിൽ ചാഞ്ഞിരുന്ന്, എന്റെ സ്വന്തം കലാസൃഷ്ടി ആസ്വദിച്ച്, അൽപ്പനേരം ഞാൻ അവിടെ അങ്ങ് ഇരുന്നു പോയി. മനസ്സിലെ വിഷമങ്ങളൊക്കെ എങ്ങോ മാഞ്ഞ് പോയത് പോലെ…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ആ പ്രഭാതത്തിൽ എനിക്കൊരു വെളിപാടുണ്ടായി. ജീവിതത്തിൽ എവിടെ ഞാൻ പരാജയപ്പെട്ടാലും എന്റെ കൂടെ രണ്ടു കാര്യങ്ങൾ എപ്പോഴും ഉണ്ടാകും: എന്റെ ബ്ലോഗും, അതിന്റെ പിന്നിലെ സ്വതന്ത്ര സോഫ്റ്റ്‌വെയറായ വേർഡ്പ്രെസും. വർഷങ്ങൾക്കിപ്പുറം, ഇന്ന് ഇന്റർനെറ്റിലെ 40 ശതമാനം വെബസൈറ്റുകൾ പ്രവർത്തിപ്പിക്കുന്ന ഇതേ സോഫ്റ്റ്‌വെയർ എന്റെ ജീവിതം മാറ്റി മറിക്കുമെന്ന് അന്ന് ഞാൻ സ്വപ്നത്തിൽ പോലും ചിന്തിരിച്ചുന്നില്ല.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ഹൗഡി, വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ്!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>കേരളതലസ്ഥാനമായ തിരുവനന്തപുരത്ത്, സർക്കാർ സർവീസിൽ ഉയർന്ന തസ്തികകളിൽ ജോലി ചെയ്യുന്ന രണ്ടു എൻജിനിയർമാരുടെ ഒറ്റ മകനായി ആണ് നമ്മുടെ ജനനം. ഓർമ വച്ച നാൾ മുതൽ തന്നെ കംപ്യൂട്ടറുകളിലും പ്രോഗ്രാമിങ്ങിലും ആയിരുന്നു കമ്പം. അതിനാൽ സ്‌കൂൾ ജീവിതം പൂർത്തിയാക്കിയ ശേഷം, തിരുവനന്തപുരത്തെ മികച്ച ഒരു എൻജിനിയറിങ് കോളേജിൽ ഇൻഫർമേഷൻ ടെക്നോളജി എഞ്ചിനിയിറങ്ങിനു ഞാൻ ചേർന്നു. അന്നേ ആഗ്രഹങ്ങൾക്കും സ്വപ്നങ്ങൾക്കും പഞ്ഞമൊന്നുമില്ലായിരുന്നു &#8211; ട്ടെക്ക് മേഖലയിൽ ജോലി ചെയ്യണമെന്നും കംപ്യൂട്ടർ സയൻസിൽ ഗവേഷണം ചെയ്യണമെന്നുമൊക്കെ ആയിരുന്നു മോഹം. കോളേജ് തുടങ്ങുന്നതിനു മുന്നേയുള്ള നാല് മാസത്തെ അവധിക്കാലത്ത് സമയം കൊല്ലാനായി കൂട്ടുകാർ നടത്തിയിരുന്നു ഒരു വെബ് സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പിൽ ഞാനും ചേർന്നു. ഒരു ദിവസം, ഒരു ക്ലയന്റിന്റെ വെബ്‌സൈറ്റ് നിർമ്മിക്കുമ്പോഴാണ് ഞാൻ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സിനെ പരിചയപ്പെടുന്നത്. HTML ഉം CSS ഉം മാത്രം ഉപയോഗിച്ച് വെബ്‌സൈറ്റ് നിർമിക്കാൻ അറിയുമായിരുന്ന എനിക്ക് അത് ഒരു അദ്‌ഭുതമായിരുന്നു. <em>“ഇപ്പോൾ കോഡ് എഴുതാതെ തന്നെ ഒരു മികച്ച ഡാഷ്‌ബോർഡ് ഉപയോഗിച്ച് മാത്രം നമുക്ക് ഒരു സൈറ്റ് ഉണ്ടാക്കാം! കൊള്ളാല്ലോ വീഡിയോൺ!”</em> അന്ന് തന്നെ സ്വന്തമായി വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് ഉപയോഗിച്ച് സൈറ്റ് നിർമിക്കിക്കാനായുള്ള പണി ഞാൻ തുടങ്ങി. എന്നാൽ ഡൊമെയ്‌നും ഹോസ്റ്റിംഗും വാങ്ങാൻ നമ്മുടെ കയ്യിൽ എവിടെ കാശ്? അതിനാൽ wordpress.com ഇൽ ഒരു ബ്ലോഗ് തുടങ്ങി തത്കാലം തൃപ്തിപ്പെട്ടു.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>വർഷങ്ങൾ നീണ്ടു നിൽക്കുന്ന ഒരു സൗഹൃദത്തിന്റെ തുടക്കമായിരുന്നു അത്. :)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>പ്രതിസന്ധികളിൽ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് സഹായത്തിനെത്തുന്നു</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>അങ്ങനെ ഒടുവിൽ അവധി കഴിഞ്ഞു കോളേജ് തുടങ്ങി. എന്നാൽ വലിയ പ്രതീക്ഷയോടെ കോളേജിലേക്ക് കാലെടുത്തു വച്ച എന്നെ കാത്തിരുന്നത് തീർത്താൽ തീരാത്ത പ്രതിസന്ധികളാണ്.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ഇന്നത്തെ ഭാരതീയ ഉപരിപഠന സമ്പ്രദായത്തിൽ പരീക്ഷകൾ മാത്രം മുന്നിൽ കണ്ട് കാണാതെ പഠിക്കുന്ന വ്യക്തികൾക്ക് മികച്ച വിജയം നേടാനാകും. എന്നാൽ പുസ്തകത്തിനപ്പുറത്തെ അറിവുകൾ കാംക്ഷിക്കുന്ന, പഠനവിഷങ്ങളുടെ പ്രായോഗിക തലങ്ങൾ തിരയുന്ന, തീർത്താൽ തീരാത്ത സംശയങ്ങളുള്ള, പുത്തൻ ആശയങ്ങൾ നിരന്തരം മെനെഞ്ഞെടുക്കുന്ന, എന്നെ പോലൊരു വ്യക്തിക്ക് പറ്റിയ ഒരു വ്യവസ്ഥിതി ആയിരുന്നില്ല അത്. കുറച്ചധികം തിക്താനുഭവങ്ങൾ വേണ്ടി വന്നു, എനിക്ക് ആ സത്യം മനസ്സിലാകാൻ. ഏറെ നാളത്തെ വിഷമങ്ങൾക്കും, സങ്കടങ്ങൾക്കുമൊടുവിൽ പഠനത്തോടുള്ള എന്റെ താത്പര്യം പാടെ നശിച്ചു എന്ന് തന്നെ പറയാം. കൂനുംമേൽ കുരു എന്നെ പോലെ എന്റെ സുഹൃത്തുക്കൾ അവരുടെ സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പിൽ നിന്നും എന്നെ പിരിച്ചു വിട്ടു. ഈ ക്ലേശകരമായ സമയം മുഴുവൻ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് ആയിരുന്നു എനിക്ക് ആകെ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്ന തുണ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>കോളേജിലെ വിഷമങ്ങൾ ഞാൻ മറന്നത് മനസ്സിലെ വേദനകൾ ബ്ലോഗിൽ സ്ഥിരമായി കുറിച്ചിട്ടുകൊണ്ടാണ്. പഠനത്തിൽ താത്പര്യം നശിച്ചിട്ടും, എന്നിലെ കെട്ടടങ്ങാത്ത ജിജ്ഞാസ, വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിൽ കോഡ് ചെയ്തും വെബ്‌സൈറ്റുകൾ നിർമിച്ചും പാഠ്യവിഷയങ്ങളുടെ പ്രായോഗിക തലങ്ങൾ കണ്ടെത്താൻ സഹായിച്ചു. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p></p><p>ചെറിയ വെബ് കരാർ ജോലികളുലൂടെയും, ഗൂഗിളിന്റെ ആഡ്‌സെൻസ് (Google AdSense) പ്രോഗ്രാം വഴി വന്ന ബ്ലോഗിലെ പരസ്യങ്ങളിലൂടെയും, ചെറിയ ഒരു വരുമാനം ഞാൻ നേടിത്തുടങ്ങി.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>വൈകാതെ സ്വന്തം ഡൊമെയ്‌നും ഹോസ്റ്റിംഗും വാങ്ങിച്ച ശേഷം self-hosted വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിലേക്ക് ഞാൻ എന്റെ ബ്ലോഗ് മാറ്റി. ചുരുക്കി പറഞ്ഞാൽ കോളേജിൽ നിന്നും പഠിച്ചതിനേക്കാൾ വിഷയങ്ങൾ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് എന്നെ പഠിപ്പിച്ചു. നാല് വർഷം കൊണ്ട് PHP, MySQL, വെബ് ഡെവെലപ്‌മെന്റ്, ഓപ്പൺ സോഴ്സ് തത്ത്വങ്ങൾ, മുതൽ പ്രഫഷണൽ എഴുത്ത് (ആംഗലേയത്തിൽ) വരെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് കാരണം ഞാൻ പഠിച്ചു. അതെ സമയം പല സമ്മാനങ്ങളും അംഗീകാരങ്ങളും എന്നെത്തേടി വന്നു തുടങ്ങി. ഇന്ത്യയിലെതന്നെ മികച്ച എഞ്ചിനിയറിങ്ങ് കോളേജുകളിൽ ഒന്നിൽ ക്ഷണിക്കപ്പെട്ട പ്രാസംഗികനാകാനും, സ്വതന്ത്ര സോഫ്റ്റ്വെയർ ഉപജ്ഞാതാക്കളിൽ പ്രമുഖനായ റിച്ചാർഡ് സ്റ്റാൾമാനെ നേരിട്ട് അഭിമുഖം ചെയ്യാനും, പ്രസിദ്ധമായ ഒരു ലോകോത്തര ഉപന്യാസ മത്സരത്തിൽ വിജയിക്കാനും, ഇന്ത്യയുടെ ഏറ്റവും മികച്ച ആംഗലേയ പത്രങ്ങളിൽ ഒന്നായ ‘ദി ഹിന്ദു’ ഇൽ ലേഖകനാകാനും എനിക്ക് സാധിച്ചു. അങ്ങനെ കഠിനമായ പ്രശ്നങ്ങളിലും വേദനകളിലും സന്തോഷം കണ്ടെത്തി വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സ് കനിഞ്ഞനുഗ്രഹിച്ചു തന്ന ശക്തിയോടെ ഞാൻ മുന്നോട്ട് നടന്നു. <span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1_Presenting_at-NITC-scaled.jpg\"><img /></a>നാഷണൽ ഇൻസ്റ്റിറ്റ്യൂട്ട് ഓഫ് ടെക്നോളജി കോഴിക്കോട് വച്ച് ബ്ലോഗ്ഗിങ്ങിനെ കുറിച്ച് ഞാൻ ഒരു പ്രസന്റേഷൻ നടത്തിയപ്പോൾ&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2_Mindful_Leadership.jpg\"><img /></a>University of Dayton, Ohio ഉം&nbsp;

എട്ടാം സെമെസ്റ്ററിൽ ഹാജർ നില കുറവായിരുന്നതിൽ ജൂനിയർ വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളോടൊപ്പം ആ സെമസ്റ്റർ റിപ്പീറ്റ് ചെയ്യാൻ പറഞ്ഞു കോളേജ് അധികൃതർ കൈയൊഴിഞ്ഞു. അതോടെ ഭാവിയെക്കുറിച്ചുള്ള എന്റെ സ്വപ്നങ്ങളെല്ലാം തകർന്നടിഞ്ഞു. പ്രതീക്ഷ കൈവിടാതെ, ഞാൻ എട്ടാം സെമസ്റ്റർ ക്‌ളാസുകൾ തുടങ്ങും മുന്നേ ഉള്ള ആറു മാസം സമയം ഏതെങ്കിലും താത്കാലിക ജോലിയിൽ ചേർന്ന് പ്രവർത്തിപരിചയം പുതുക്കാം എന്ന് തീരുമാനിച്ചു. അങ്ങനെ, തിരുവനന്തപുരം ആസ്ഥാനമായ ഒരു വെബ് പോർട്ടലിൽ പത്രപ്രവർത്തകനായി തുച്ഛശമ്പളത്തോടെയുള്ള ജോലിയിൽ പ്രവേശിച്ചു. അവിടെയും ഈ പാവത്തിന് തോൽവികൾ മാത്രം ബാക്കി. അവിടെ രണ്ടു മാസം തികയ്ക്കുന്നതിന് തികയ്ക്കുന്നതിന് മുന്നേ അവർ എന്നെ മറുപുറം നോക്കാതെ പിരിച്ചു വിട്ടു. കിട്ടിയതോ, കരാർ പ്രകാരമുള്ള (തുച്ഛ) ശമ്പളത്തിന്റെ നേർപ്പകുതിയും;

പണ്ടേ എനിക്കുണ്ടായിരുന്നു &#8211; ഈ സംഭവങ്ങളോട് കൂടി&nbsp; ഞാൻ അത് ഉറപ്പിച്ചു. നാട്ടുകാരുടെയും വീട്ടുകാരുടെയും കുത്തുവാക്കുകളും പരിഹാസവും സഹിക്കാവുന്നതിനുമപ്പുറത്തായിരുന്നു. ഇതൊന്നും പോരാഞ്ഞിട്ട് എനിക്കെന്തോ കാര്യമായ കുഴപ്പമുണ്ടെന്ന ധാരണയോടെ, എന്റെ പ്രതിഷേധം വകവയ്ക്കാതെ, വീട്ടുകാർ നിർബന്ധപൂർവം എന്നെ ഒരു പ്രശസ്ത സൈക്യാട്രിസ്റ്റ്നെ കാണിച്ചു. ആദേശം എനിക്ക് കൊടിയ മാനസിക വിഭ്രാന്തിയാണെന്ന് വിധിയെഴുതിയെന്ന് മാത്രമല്ല ഹെവി ഡോസ്&nbsp; മരുന്നുകളും കല്പിച്ചു നൽകി. (പിടിച്ചു ചങ്ങലയ്ക്കിടാഞ്ഞത് എന്റെ ഭാഗ്യം!) മേൽപ്പറഞ്ഞ മരുന്നിന്റെ പാർശ്വഫലങ്ങൾ കാരണം ബാക്കിയുണ്ടായിരുന്ന മനസ്സമാധാനവും പോയി. പച്ച മലയാളത്തിൽ പറഞ്ഞാൽ എന്റെ ജീവിതം അതോടെ മൊത്തമായും ചില്ലറയായും നായ നക്കി.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ഇത്രയൊക്കെ അനുഭവിച്ചിട്ടും, എന്റെ കൂടെ ഒരാൾ അപ്പോഴും കൂട്ടിനുണ്ടായിരുന്നു &#8211; നമ്മുടെ പഴയ സുഹൃത്തായ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ്!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>തീയിൽ കുരുത്താൽ വെയിലത്തു വാടില്ല എന്നാണല്ലോ പഴമൊഴി. അങ്ങനെ തീയിൽ കത്തി നശിച്ചു വെയിലത്തു ഒരു കരികട്ട പോലെ കിടന്നുരുകുമ്പോളാണ് എനിക്ക് ഒരു സത്യം മനസ്സിലായത്. ജീവിതത്തിൽ എന്തൊക്കെ നഷ്ടപ്പെട്ടാലും എനിക്കുള്ള വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് പരിജ്ഞാനം ഒരിക്കലും നഷ്ടപ്പെടില്ല. വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിൽ ഞാനൊരു പുലി തന്നെ ആയിരുന്നു എന്ന് മാത്രമല്ല വേർഡ്പ്രെസ്സിൽ എന്ത് വേണമെങ്കിലും ചെയ്യാം എന്ന ആത്മവിശ്വാസവും എനിക്കുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. അങ്ങനെ പൂജ്യത്തിൽ നിന്നും ഞാൻ പതുക്കെ കര കയറി തുടങ്ങി. ഇടയ്ക്കൊക്കെ ചെയ്തിരുന്ന കരാറടിസ്ഥാനത്തിലുള്ള ജോലികൾ (freelancing) സ്ഥിരമായി ചെയ്തായിരുന്നു എന്റെ തുടക്കം. വരുമാനമൊക്കെ കണക്കായിരുന്നു, പക്ഷെ എന്റെ ആവശ്യങ്ങൾക്കുള്ള പണം കിട്ടുന്നുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. ഓരോ ജോലി തീർത്തു കൊടുക്കുമ്പോഴും ക്ലയന്റ്സിന്റെ നല്ല വാക്കുകൾ കേൾക്കുമ്പോഴും ആത്മവിശ്വാസം വർധിക്കുന്നത് ഞാനറിഞ്ഞു. വീട്ടുകാർക്ക് അപ്പോഴും എന്നോട് നല്ല പുച്ഛമായിരുന്നു &#8211; ഞാൻ ജോലി ചെയ്യുമ്പോൾ പോയി പഠിക്കാനോ ജോലിക്ക് അപേക്ഷിക്കാനോ ഒക്കെ പറഞ്ഞു അവർ എന്നെ വഴക്കു പറയുമായിരുന്നു. ഞാൻ അതൊന്നും കാര്യമാക്കാതെ ജോലിയിൽ മുഴുകി. വൈകാതെ കോളേജ് എന്ന പെരുമൺ ദുരന്തം അവസാനിച്ചു. ഇതിനിടെ, വീട്ടുകാരറിയാതെ,&nbsp; അറിയപ്പെടുന്ന മറ്റൊരു സൈക്കോളജിസ്റ്റിനെ ഞാൻ കണ്ടു. വിദഗ്‌ധ പരിശോധനയ്ക്ക് ശേഷം എനിക്ക് മാനസിക ബുദ്ധിമുട്ട് ഒന്നും തന്നെ ഇല്ല എന്ന് അദ്ദേഹം വിധിയെഴുതുകയും, മരുന്നുകൾ നിർത്തുകയും ചെയ്തു. പതുക്കെ ഞാൻ ജീവിതത്തിലേക്ക് വീണ്ടും പിച്ച വച്ച് തുടങ്ങി.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>പിന്നീടങ്ങോട്ട് എന്റെ വളർച്ചയുടെ കാലമായിരുന്നു &#8211; ചെറിയ ചെറിയ കാൽവയ്പുകളും കുഞ്ഞു കുഞ്ഞു സന്തോഷങ്ങളും. വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് എനിക്ക് ഒടുവിൽ ‘നല്ല’ ഒരു ജോലി നേടി തന്നു. കൊച്ചി ആസ്ഥാനമായ ഒരു ടെക്‌നോളജി സ്റ്റാർട്ടപ്പ് എന്നെ അവരുടെ പ്രൊജക്റ്റ് മാനേജരായി നിയമിച്ചു. എന്റെ പ്രധാന ജോലി അവിടുത്തെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് വെബ്‌സൈറ്റുകളുടെ ഒരു ശൃംഖല നടത്തിക്കൊണ്ടു പോവുക എന്നതായിരുന്നു &#8211; ഞാൻ ഒത്തിരി സന്തോഷത്തോടുകൂടിയും ആത്മാർത്ഥതയോടുകൂടിയും&nbsp; ആ ജോലി ഏറ്റെടുത്തു. എന്റെ ബോസും, കൂടെ ജോലി ചെയ്യുന്ന ആൾകാരുമൊക്കെ എന്നെ ഒത്തിരി അഭിനന്ദിച്ചു. അങ്ങനെ വൈകിയാണെങ്കിലും ഞാൻ ജീവിത വിജയത്തിന്റെ ആദ്യ പടവുകളിലേക്കെത്തി. തുടർന്ന് പല ജോലികൾ ചെയ്ത ശേഷം ഒടുവിൽ ഇന്ത്യയിലെ ഒരു പ്രധാന പൊതു മേഖല ബാങ്കിൽ എനിക്ക് ജോലി കിട്ടി. ഈ സമയത്താണ് ഞാൻ ഒരു സ്നേഹനിധിയായ പെൺകുട്ടിയെ പരിചയപ്പെടുന്നതും അവളെ ജീവിതസഖിയാക്കുന്നതും. കല്യാണം കഴിഞ്ഞ് ഞങ്ങൾ ഒരു ഫ്ലാറ്റ് വാടകയ്‌ക്കെടുത്തു ഒരുമിച്ചു ജീവിതം തുടങ്ങി. ഒരു വ്യാഴവട്ട കാലത്തിനു ശേഷം ജീവിതത്തിലാദ്യമായി ഞാനും സ്വന്തം കാലിൽ ഞാനും നിന്നു തുടങ്ങി &#8211; എല്ലാ രീതിയിലും!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ഇതിനിടെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് എന്റെ മനസ്സിൽ നിന്നും പോയിരുന്നില്ല. ബാങ്കിൽ ഡെപ്പോസിറ്റുകൾ സ്വീകരിക്കുമ്പോഴും ലോണുകൾ നൽകുമ്പോഴും എന്ത് വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ്, എന്ന് നിങ്ങൾ ചിന്തിക്കുന്നുണ്ടാവും. എന്നാൽ സമയം കിട്ടുമ്പോഴൊക്കെ ഞാൻ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് പൊടി തട്ടി എടുക്കുമായിരുന്നു &#8211; അത് ഒരു പ്രത്യേക സന്തോഷം തന്നെ ആയിരുന്നു! എന്റെ റ്റ്വിറ്റർ ബയോയിൽ ഞാൻ അപ്പോഴും എന്നെത്തന്നെ വിളിച്ചിരുന്നത് ഒരു “WordPress guru” എന്നുതന്നെയാണ്. കുറച്ചു നാളുകൾക്ക് ശേഷം ബാങ്ക് ജോലി എനിക്ക് നന്നേ മടുത്തു. കരിയറിന്റെ അടുത്ത പടിയിലേക്ക് കാൽ വയ്ക്കാൻ സമയമായി, എന്ന് എനിക്ക് തോന്നി തുടങ്ങി.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ഓട്ടോമാറ്റിക്കിന്റെ കടന്നുവരവ്</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>കരിയറിനെക്കുറിച്ച് ആലോചിച്ചപ്പോൾ എന്നിലെ വേർഡ്പ്രസ്സ് പ്രേമി ആദ്യം ആലോചിച്ചത് ഓട്ടോമാറ്റിക്കിനെക്കുറിച്ച് തന്നെയാണ്. ഇങ്ങനെ ഒരു കമ്പനിയുണ്ട് എന്ന് മനസ്സിലാക്കിയ ശേഷം കഴിഞ്ഞ ആറ് വർഷത്തിനിടയിൽ കമ്പനി വെബ്സൈറ്റിലെ ജോലികളെക്കുറിച്ചുള്ള പേജ് ഒരു നൂറു തവണയിൽ കൂടുതലെങ്കിലും ഞാൻ സന്ദർശിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടാവണം. എന്തിനേറെ പറയുന്നു &#8211; പല തവണ ഞാൻ ജോലിക്ക് അപേക്ഷ അയക്കാൻ തുനിഞ്ഞതുമാണ്! എന്നെ പിടിച്ചു നിർത്തിയത് എന്നിലെ മുടിഞ്ഞ ആത്മവിശ്വാസമില്ലായ്മയായിരുന്നു. ഒരു സർക്കാരിതര സ്ഥാപനത്തിൽ ജോലി കിട്ടിയതിനു ശേഷവും കുടുംബത്തിലെ പുച്ഛത്തിനും പരിഹാസത്തിനും യാതൊരു കുറവുമില്ലായിരുന്നു എന്നത് തന്നെ കാര്യം! </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>എന്നിൽ അടിയുറച്ച വിശ്വവാസമുള്ള ഒരാൾ മാത്രമേ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നുള്ളു &#8211; അത് മറ്റാരുമല്ല &#8211; എന്റെ ഭാര്യ അർച്ചന തന്നെ. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>ഒരിക്കൽ രണ്ടും കല്പിച്ചു ഓട്ടമാറ്റികിൽ ജോലി ചെയ്യാനുള്ള എന്റെ അതിയായ ആഗ്രഹം ഭാര്യയോട് ഞാൻ പറഞ്ഞു. പുള്ളിക്കാരിയുടെ ഉത്തരം അക്ഷരാർത്ഥത്തിൽ എന്റെ കണ്ണ് നനയിച്ചു! “ചുമ്മാ അപ്ലൈ ചെയ്തോ, എങ്ങനെ പോയാലും ജോലി കിട്ടും &#8211;
